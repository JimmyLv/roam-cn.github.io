    -  ""Tell the truth — or, at least, don’t lie""
        - Why roam is built for private use 1st is that a person is usually honest with “himself”
            - It’s no point for you to lie when you are with yourself.
            - But when it comes to group or organization,under the public scenarios,people will do self-propagating. Sometimes they hide things and, they lie. 
            - So the most difficult part is not to persuade the organizations to use roam to build their 2nd brain to reduce frictions ,it’s not the concern of how to protect the privacy. It’s whether they can be honest to themselves.
            - Individuals seek for truth , group search for consensus.

    - ""Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them""
        - same,do not let yourself do anything that make you dislike you.
        - 一诺说，想起纪伯伦写的孩子，其实读起来很刺耳，像这一节：
            - For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
            - You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
            - 因为他们的灵魂属于明天，属于你做梦也无法到达的明天。
            - 你可以拼尽全力，变得像他们一样，却不要让他们变得和你一样。
            - 因为生命不会后退，也不在过去停留。
