- [@Jessie](@Jessie.md)
    - [The beginning of Infinity](The beginning of Infinity.md) ~ **"explain"** the universe
        - **[show a piece(截一小段)](show a piece(截一小段).md):** If we were to speed up the accumulation and application of knowledge through innovation, we would be able to solve all of humanity’s problems. And we’re always at the beginning of this infinity, as he says, because there’s an infinite amount of progress to be made. There’s so far to go that when you look at where we are at any given point on that curve, infinity stretches out in front of you.
    - [World after capital](World after capital.md) ~ what's the most **scarcity**?
        - **[show a piece(截一小段)](show a piece(截一小段).md):** And yet there is something special about our time: we are experiencing a technological non-linearity, in which the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, thus rendering predictions based on extrapolation useless. The current non-linearity arises from the extraordinary power of digital technology, which far exceeds anything that was possible with industrial machinery, due to two unique characteristics. **Digital technology delivers ‘universality of computation**’ (it can compute anything) at ‘zero marginal cost’ (extra copies can be produced for free).
    - [The Quotable Feynman](The Quotable Feynman.md) ~ science and curiosity
        - **[show a piece(截一小段)](show a piece(截一小段).md):** I suffer from the disease that all professors suffer from- that is, there never seems to be enough time, and I invented more problems than undoubtedly well be able to do, and th ererore I've tried to speed things up by writing some things on the board beforehand. with the illusion that every professor has: that if he talks about more things, hell teach more things. Of course here's only a finite rate at which material can be absorbed by the human mind, yet we disregard that phenomenon, and in spite of it we go too fast
        - **[potential related books](potential related books.md):** [Richard Feynman](Richard Feynman.md)'s [12 Favorite Questions](12 Favorite Questions.md)
    - [Big magic](Big magic.md) ~ **creativity** operating system
        - **[show a piece(截一小段)](show a piece(截一小段).md):** 
        - **[potential related books](potential related books.md):** [B-Net and the Butterfly](B-Net and the Butterfly.md)
    - [Word power made easy](Word power made easy.md)~ language learning, knowledge building
        - **[show a piece(截一小段)](show a piece(截一小段).md):** words is the symptom of knowledge 
- [@Thomas](@Thomas.md)
    - [The 5AM Club](The 5AM Club.md)
    - [The Order Of Time](The Order Of Time.md)
    - [Never Eat Alone](Never Eat Alone.md)
    - [Autobiography of a Yogi](Autobiography of a Yogi.md)
- [@多酱](@多酱.md)
    - [把自己作为方法](把自己作为方法.md)~个人经验问题化
        - **[show a piece(截一小段)](show a piece(截一小段).md):** 个人经验本身并不是那么重要，把个人经验问题化是一个重要方法。我们关心的是世界，不是自己，现在关键就是从哪里开始了解这个世界，同时也更好地了解自己，把个人自己的经历问题化，就是一个了解世界的具体开始。
