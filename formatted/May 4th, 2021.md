### the art of Synthesis
    - pre-Synthesis
        - [Topics](Topics.md) page for things you want to develop content
        - **highlight** for the background of your Synthesis
        - Executive summary is written for you, for future you
    - Synthesis
        - block types
            - the importance of academic writing/trainning
            - F-note
                - label at the **back**
            - L-note
                - restate what the F-note say
                - label at the **front**
            - R-note
                - summarize in your own words; above and beyond what has been stated in the F-note, it's the connection you made in your head between that idea and something else; your contribution beyond the L-note
                - label at the **front**
            - Q-note
                - the beginning of Z-note
                - R-note supports the Q-note,but not enough
                    - R-note drives the Q-note, coz you cannot get a fixed statement of belief from a single sentence in a single source. So the Q-note is the thing you want to research on.
                        - 一个观点在一种语境下会自带立场，这种立场具有片面性
                - label at the **front**
            - Z-note
                - at the **page** level
                - robust support for your thesis
                    - 对于产出来说，Z-note可以是一段时间的产物

        - 15'25 Page--placing them is difficult than blocks you can play around, so prefer atomic notes
