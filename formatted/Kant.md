-  The proper answer to my question 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?' is, I believed, 'By __criticizing__ the theories or guesses of others and — if we can train ourselves to do so — by __criticizing__ our own theories or guesses.' (The latter point is highly desirable, but not indispensable; for if we fail to criticize our own theories, there may be others to do it for us.) This answer sums up a position which I propose to call 'critical rationalism'. It is a view, an attitude, and a tradition, which we owe to the Greeks. It is very different from the 'rationalism' or 'intellectualism' of Descartes and his school, and very different even from the epistemology of [Kant](Kant.md).
