- In view of this bold statement, it seems strange that in his philosophy of science Kant did not adopt the same attitude of critical rationalism, of the critical search for error. I feel certain that it was only his acceptance of the authority of Newton's [ [Issac Newton](Issac Newton.md) ] cosmology — a result of its almost unbelievable success is passing the most severe tests — which prevented Kant from doing so. If this interpretation of Kant is correct, then the critical rationalism (and also the critical empiricism) which I advocate merely put the finishing touch to Kant's own critical philosophy. And this was made possible by Einstein [ [Albert Einstein](Albert Einstein.md)
