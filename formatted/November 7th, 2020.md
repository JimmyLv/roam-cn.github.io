    - "嗯嗯是的，这个话题值得讨论。其实我一直觉得permissionless的东西的力量很大（像比特币社区），chaotic的状态下分布式组织大脑怎样有效——我觉得Roam就是为这种场景而生的"
        - 比特币以前我对它有偏见，但是看了一下简介之后，我发现它也是分布式的一种代表。**分布式是未来的趋势无误**。
    - 我觉得现在沟通的方法不是很好用？
        - 是不是每句话都 #[@Jessie](@Jessie.md) 一下，然后你才能在自己的page里面看到具体的信息？
        - 另外，`reaction` 本身也不会提示。
    - 之前葫芦笔记的技术上的创始人好像就说过，国内资本不太认可国内的创新。背书还要漫游者。我在知乎看到了一些争论。
        - 讲道理...别说国内资本了，连我这么一个小平民都不认可。国内现在的所谓创新毫无创新。
    - 这两天搞了个小玩意，详见👇

            - **[show a piece](show a piece.md):** If we were to speed up the accumulation and application of knowledge through innovation, we would be able to solve all of humanity’s problems. And we’re always at the beginning of this infinity, as he says, because there’s an infinite amount of progress to be made. There’s so far to go that when you look at where we are at any given point on that curve, infinity stretches out in front of you.

        - [World after capital](World after capital.md) ~ what's the most **scarcity**?
            - **[show a piece](show a piece.md):** And yet there is something special about our time: we are experiencing a technological non-linearity, in which the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, thus rendering predictions based on extrapolation useless. The current non-linearity arises from the extraordinary power of digital technology, which far exceeds anything that was possible with industrial machinery, due to two unique characteristics. **Digital technology delivers ‘universality of computation**’ (it can compute anything) at ‘zero marginal cost’ (extra copies can be produced for free).
        - [The Quotable Feynman](The Quotable Feynman.md) ~ science and curiosity
            - **[show a piece](show a piece.md):** I suffer from the disease that all professors suffer from- that is, there never seems to be enough time, and I invented more problems than undoubtedly well be able to do, and th ererore I've tried to speed things up by writing some things on the board beforehand. with the illusion that every professor has: that if he talks about more things, hell teach more things. Of course here's only a finite rate at which material can be absorbed by the human mind, yet we disregard that phenomenon, and in spite of it we go too fast
