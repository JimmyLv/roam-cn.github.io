    - The writers' workshop is a dance, and without knowing the steps, a participant mighe trip, even fal. Feet could be sprained or even broken—one should never participate in a writets' workshop without an introduction o it of some sort and the ground rules being set. You need a moderator or workshop leader—someone with experience and, even better, expertise i the workshop and a mas-cee writer, The feet that are most badly hurt will not be those of the experienced,
buc those of a new writer, a young person, and it not out of the realm of possibiley that a career might be changed by the wrong kind of statement at the wrong time. The conversations in a writers workshop are not a debate, not a chat, not an argument, not a forum €0 show off, not a flame war, not a love-fest,ot a shouting match, not a lecture, not a demonstration, and certainly not a cakewalk.
