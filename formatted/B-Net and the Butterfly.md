        - To Dr. Marcus Raichle, discoverer of the default
        - mode network, whose breakthrough made our work possible, whose science
underlies this entire book, and for whose guidance we are profoundly grateful.
        - Title Page
        - Introduction
            - IN A SMALL city in Switzerland on a fine spring day in 1905, a young patent clerk left his one-year-old son and wife at home to go see his best friend about a riddle. The two friends loved exchanging ideas, from philosophy to physics, from art to electricity, and this morning our young patent clerk wanted to discuss a problem that had been vexing him for some time.
            - For the past year, he’d been especially focused on a physics theory he’d begun formulating ten years ago. He laid out every detail of the problem he had been struggling with, and for an entire day the two friends analyzed ideas and rehashed every aspect of the dilemma.
            - As the sun set, the young man finally concluded that the theory he’d been working on for a decade was going nowhere. It had hit a brick wall. Demoralized and dejected, he declared that he was giving up the entire quest. And so Albert Einstein shuffled home and went to sleep.
            - You can imagine his friend’s surprise the next morning when, answering an urgent knock, he opened the door to see Einstein, who bypassed polite greetings and blurted out, “Thank you. I’ve completely solved the problem.” With that, he returned home and began to write. Einstein spent the next six weeks writing out one of the most important scientific contributions of all time: the special theory of relativity.1
            - What happened inside Einstein’s brain that night? After years of effort, why did the answer suddenly appear just when he had given up?
            - Einstein’s experience was a classic example of the way our brain creates breakthrough ideas, completely new and novel ways of solving problems and looking at the world. And believe it or not, if you’ve ever had a breakthrough, the exact same thing happened inside your brain, too.
            - This process was deliberately, consciously used by both Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison. Dali would put his elbow on a table and rest his chin on his upturned palm with a spoon between his chin and his palm. He would let himself drift off to sleep. As his muscles relaxed, the spoon would drop and rattle against the table, waking him up. Dali would then sketch the exact concept in his mind at that moment. Edison had a strikingly similar habit of napping in his chair with a handful of marbles. The moment the marbles’ clatter woke him up, he would write down whatever was in his mind.2
            - For many, breakthroughs are like butterflies—beautiful and awe-inspiring, yet erratic and elusive. Some people think they happen through hard work and concentration. The harder you focus on the breakthrough you’re seeking, the more likely you are to get it. Others think they are spontaneous, inexplicable, and unpredictable. We describe these moments of inspiration as “eureka” or “aha” moments, or we speak of “having a lightbulb go off.” They’re purely accidental, and there’s no way to induce them. Still others believe they are for the lucky and the extraordinary. The truth is that we all can have breakthroughs.
            - In fact, breakthroughs are not accidental, they can be induced, and we are going to show you how. Thanks to new neuroscience research, we now know how the breakthrough process works and we have tools to access it.3 Breakthroughs, like butterflies, may fly an unpredictable path, but it is possible to capture them if we build the right net.
            - Advances in neuroscience have revealed that these seemingly unpredictable, sudden, and singular flashes are actually a predictable part of an integrated mental process.4 Einstein described the breakthrough moment as arriving “suddenly, and in a rather intuitive way. That means it is not reached by conscious logical conclusions.”5 But this sudden flash of insight is actually the only visible step of a much longer process, and Einstein knew it. “Thinking it through afterwards, you can always discover the reasons. . . . Intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience.”
            - Every single person on the planet has the ability to generate creative breakthroughs inside their brains: you can’t be born without it. We all have a natural ability to create butterflies. However, you may not know how to get the most out of it, or even how to access it. You need skills and practice to build and wield a net.
            - Breakthrough thinkers impact the world, whether they’re Louis Pasteur, Steve Jobs, or Mahatma Gandhi. Breakthroughs advance science and civilization. Breakthrough thinking gave us modern medicine, from Velcro6 to the pacemaker.7 The power of breakthrough thinking is equally valuable at home: you could have a breakthrough about what’s been holding you back from getting into a relationship, or what you need to fix in your marriage.
            - Breakthrough thinking is also critical in business: innovation breakthroughs are worth millions, sometimes billions. Right now, companies are spending time and effort to create a culture of innovation breakthroughs around their employees. But what about the inside of their employees’ heads? As it turns out, even if your employees are surrounded by an innovative organization or culture, if their mental culture isn’t conducive, potential breakthroughs will never be realized.
            - Are you being asked to be far more creative at work than you signed on for? Does your path forward in your career suddenly depend on your ability to be innovative? Has breakthrough thinking become an expectation rather than an aspiration? Whether you already have regular breakthroughs and want to be able to direct them, or think that you just don’t have that kind of brain, we have good news: breakthrough thinking is a skill that you can acquire and practice.
            - In the following pages, you are going to learn all about how your brain’s breakthrough process works, how to access it, what might be holding it back, and how to turbocharge it.
            - We do, however, want to be clear: we will not be giving you a magic formula. Owning a net isn’t sufficient to catch butterflies: you need practice, patience, skill, and a little luck. Because the breakthrough experience varies by individual, there is no guaranteed step-by-step procedure. No one breakthrough looks exactly like any other; they all emerge through their own unique process. That’s why the breakthrough experience is not a directed, repeatable, linear one, but rather an evolving, unfolding, creative process with many different elements.
            - What we are giving you is a framework and a set of tools to increase the chances of breakthroughs. There’s a common saying that “luck is preparation meets opportunity.” In this book, you’ll learn how to prepare yourself so you can make the most of the opportunities that present themselves. We offer you tools and techniques from a broad range of disciplines—from behavioral and cognitive psychology to neuroscience and meditation, from peak performance athletic conditioning to Hollywood Method acting. In this sense, breakthrough thinking is like mixed martial arts, taking the most effective tools from anywhere, valuing effectiveness over style. This book helps you put the science into practice so that you can accelerate your learning curve.
            - We know that a person’s breakthrough level can be increased with the right methods because we’ve helped countless clients increase theirs in this way. We’ve brought these breakthrough tools to the U.S. Army Special Forces and to Stanford’s Student Enterprise Accelerator, StartX, in the heart of Silicon Valley.
            - Through these tools our clients have experienced breakthroughs in areas as disparate as predicting the political outcome of the Arab Spring, creating new medical technology devices, or breaking through executive team deadlocks. They’ve reported astonishing results that have transformed their practices, and you’ll find some of their stories in the pages that follow.
            - We have both been fascinated with breakthroughs for decades, and in our pursuit of breakthroughs, we’ve tried some crazy stuff. We’ve studied sports psychology, Jungian archetypes, depth hypnosis, sensory deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and an entire alphabet soup of other acronym-worthy experiences. Just as we’ve passed on the best insights and tools to our clients, we’re now giving them to you.
            - In this book, you’ll find unique knowledge drawn from a variety of sciences and the techniques you need to apply this knowledge. Your life will become your lab, and you’ll get infinite opportunities to experiment. Becoming a breakthrough thinker does involve work—work that is sometimes hard, uncomfortable, and confronting. But it’s also incredibly rewarding.
            - There is no substitute for doing the exercises in this book. Skimming through them with the earnest intention of completing them “another day” is not enough, nor is doing only the exercises that seem easy or interesting. When an exercise asks you to close your eyes and imagine a scene, really close your eyes and imagine. When we ask you to write out a scenario, grab a pen and paper and write. If we ask you to do something, it’s for a good reason, and it will have a real impact on your level of breakthrough thinking.
            - In part one, we’ll talk about what breakthroughs are (and aren’t) and look at the inner workings of your brain’s breakthrough process. This is where you’ll get to feel your breakthrough network in action, and learn to tell the difference between the various modes your brain can switch into.
            - Then we’ll lay out the breakthrough experience for you. You’ll learn how to get yourself into the right mental state and collect the facts, stories, knowledge, and experiences needed to fuel your creative process.
            - You’ll learn how to turbocharge your brain’s breakthrough power by increasing your level of neuroplasticity, using your brain’s ability to constantly rewire itself every time you think a new thought.
            - Putting It into Practice: A Thirty-Second Neuroplasticity Booster
            - Every time you think a new thought, all over your brain new structures are created. Yes, really.
            - Want to know what that feels like? Here you go.
            - Trace your route to work in your head. Be as specific as you can: imagine the signs, the landmarks, the streetlights and traffic signs. Imagine making the turns you would have to make, the buildings, stores, or restaurants you would pass by.
            - That feeling of trying to assemble images in your mind, of organizing them in the right order, the slightly awkward feeling of doing something for the first time? That’s neuroplasticity at work. Your brain is physically creating new structures.
            - In part two, we’ll talk about your butterflies’ natural predators: the forces that prevent breakthroughs from happening inside your mind. Did you know that the three leading causes of butterfly demise are spiders, wasps, and cold? They have equivalents inside your brain: the spiders of fear, the wasps of failure, and the icy cold of uncertainty. Fear, failure, and uncertainty are the breakthrough blockers that can trap your insights and limit your potential. There are breakthroughs you could be having, right now, that are trapped inside your mind, just waiting to be released. With the right techniques, you can neutralize these negative forces and let your butterflies soar. (If you can’t wait to get started, jump straight to here.)
            - Finally, in the last chapter we’ll talk about the SuperTools—tools that will supercharge all areas of your breakthrough process. And for the nerds among you, we’ve included more information about the brain science of breakthroughs in the Science Appendix.
            - By using the tools in this book, you will open the door to your brain’s ability to cut through the noise and see your brilliant breakthrough ideas. These breakthroughs could change your business, your personal life, your physical and emotional well-being, your learning agility, your perspective on the world, your perception of yourself. Exponentially and incrementally, it could change anything or everything about you and who you are. To have breakthroughs, you don’t have to be special. You don’t have to be brilliant. You don’t have to be privileged or even well educated. All you have to know is what you’re looking for and how to find it.

            - Chapter 1: The Four Wings
                - All About Breakthroughs
                - YET ANOTHER DROP of ink leaked from his fountain pen onto the page, and László Bíró threw down his pen in disgust. A Hungarian newspaper editor who earned his salary by writing, he was frustrated with the tools of his trade. He seemed to spend his time either filling up his fountain pens, or cleaning up the smudges they made.1
                - Of course he was grateful for the invention of the fountain pen: it was a vast improvement over feather quills. But it still meant ink splotches and ruined pages that had to be written all over again.
                - Why couldn’t the ink from his fountain be more like the ink used to print his newspaper? Bíró already knew the answer: newspaper ink was much too thick for his fountain pen. Right ink, wrong pen. Deciding to use the newspaper ink was a good idea. But it wasn’t a breakthrough.
                - The breakthrough came with a new way to deliver the ink. Rather than trying to get the thick ink to flow through a nib, Bíró and his brother figured out how to set a metal ball in a socket and let the thick ink roll out from behind the ball.
                - Now let’s be clear—ballpoint pens had been attempted before. They just hadn’t worked until then. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were just two of the many issues that made them impractical. The breakthrough came when Bíró made the ballpoint pen viable.
                - In business, a breakthrough is often described as an idea that solves a problem or satisfies a need in an entirely new way. Although there is no single definition of breakthroughs, we define them quite simply as the moment when you break through something that was previously limiting you, whether it’s a specific problem you couldn’t find a solution to, a situation you couldn’t understand, or simply an old way of doing or seeing things.
                - Sociologist and author Martha Beck describes the experience of breakthrough as “a shift in your understanding of the world, because the lens through which you view the world has been suddenly, gloriously changed. And boy, do breakthroughs feel amazing.”2 A breakthrough is a sudden advance in your knowledge or understanding that moves you past a barrier and makes you see things, understand things in a new way. Although all breakthroughs come from the same process in the brain, not all breakthroughs come in the same way.
                - There are two main kinds of breakthroughs: intentional and unintentional. You’ll face some of the same obstacles with both, but these obstacles will play out in different ways. Fear, for instance, impedes both intentional and unintentional breakthroughs—but it rears its ugly head at different stages of the breakthrough experience. For intentional breakthroughs, fear interferes before the breakthrough, bringing up the possibility of failure.
                - Fear seeps in after unintentional breakthroughs, and it centers on the oncoming challenges of implementing a solution. For instance, you suddenly realize (breakthrough) that you need a divorce. Anxiety might arise as you foresee the unpleasantness that all too often accompanies the process (implementation) of divorcing.
                - Or perhaps you suddenly realize (breakthrough) you’ve fallen in love with a close friend. You could fear being rejected after making your new feelings known (implementation), or, confusingly, fear success and the life changes it would entail.
                - For unintentional breakthroughs, landing on a solution isn’t the end goal: you need to act on it. As Beck says, “Having breakthroughs isn’t the point. Living them is. Seeing in a new way is only the beginning.” Fear is a powerful saboteur of this process.
                - Although all breakthroughs come from the same process in the brain, not all breakthroughs come in the same way. We have identified four different types: eureka breakthrough, metaphorical breakthrough, intuitive breakthrough, and paradigm breakthrough. Understanding the different kinds of breakthroughs will help you spot them so you don’t miss a single one. It will also help you discover the style, or styles, that are most natural to you so you can learn to focus on the way that works best for you.
                - The key is to understand that no style of breakthrough is better or more productive than another. It is simply best to understand which style or styles come most naturally to you.
                - Eureka Breakthrough
                    - Eureka translates from the Greek as “I’ve got it” or “That’s it.” In popular culture, it has come to describe the moment when someone experiences a sudden, unexpected realization.
                    - Archimedes, the original “Eureka!” shouter, was a Greek mathematician and scientist living in ancient Sicily in the third century B.C. One day, he was asked by King Hiero, ruler of the city-state, to determine whether a crown was made of real gold. Since gold had a known density, all he had to do was measure the density of the crown and see whether it matched up.
                    - The first part of measuring density was easy: determine the crown’s weight. But the second part required measuring the crown’s exact volume. Now, measuring the volume of an object like a cube is simple. But how do you determine the volume of an object as irregularly shaped as a crown?
                    - Archimedes puzzled on the problem until one day while taking a bath. As he stepped into the bathtub, he watched the water rise, displaced by his leg. He realized that, just as the water had risen to accommodate the new volume of his leg, it would rise in response to the volume of the crown. So he could submerge the crown and measure the amount of water displaced to know the crown’s volume, and thus calculate its density. He cried “Eureka!” and jumped out of his bath and ran through the streets of Syracuse stark naked, shouting all the way.
                    - We tend to have eureka insights when we’ve been mulling over a problem for some time. Take, for example, the time two helicopter mechanics in the Army Reserve saved the army tens of millions of dollars because of their shared love of NASCAR.3
                    - During the Iraq War, desert sand and dust were damaging helicopter windshields faster than the army could replace them, and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars every month. Lexan, the shatter-resistant plastic the windshields were made of, tended to scratch easily.
                    - As it happens, Lexan is also used to make NASCAR windshields. But to solve the scratching problem, NASCAR drivers had learned to cover their windshields with thin sheets of transparent Mylar film they called “tearaways.” At the end of each race, the used Mylar sheet is torn off, and the Lexan windshield underneath is left without a scratch.
                    - Two national guardsmen on a helicopter maintenance crew in Virginia happened to be big NASCAR fans. As they surveyed the extent of the damage done to their helicopters’ Lexan windshields, they were hit with the possibility that NASCAR’s solution could solve the army’s problem. Creatively reapplying an existing solution is a common type of eureka insight. In fact, NASCAR first borrowed the Mylar technique from motorcycle racers protecting their helmets.
                    - When eureka breakthroughs happen, they happen fast. They are the proverbial lightning bolt over the head. Many people report the sensation of receiving information from a location “above.” And this sudden discovery of an immediately applicable solution is incredibly exciting.
                    - Eureka insights are the ones that your author Olivia gets most often (she’s ruthlessly pragmatic). These ideas arrive with a clear mental picture of how to execute them and the confidence that they’ll work.
                    - They are most likely to come when you have been living with a problem or a block. This problem is interfering with your peace of mind; you think about it often during the day. But the actual breakthrough will most likely occur when you’re no longer thinking about the problem.
                    - James Watt did not invent the steam engine.4 In 1764, at the University of Glasgow, he was repairing what was known as a Newcomen steam engine, which Watt considered very inefficient. He worked on the problem until one spring day in 1765, he was walking through a park when the breakthrough came to him: he needed two cylinders.5 Eureka! Watt’s breakthrough made the engine so much more powerful and efficient that it ushered in the true age of steam.
                    - A century later, the next great breakthrough in power occurred in a remarkably similar way. Nikola Tesla had been working on the concept of an alternating current motor for a few years. One day while walking through a park in Budapest he had a feverish vision of an alternating current motor complete with three slightly out of phase magnetic fields turning the drive shaft.6 The solution had appeared fully formed. Eureka!
                    - This is part of the grand paradox of breakthrough thinking. In order to have a eureka breakthrough, you have to be deeply immersed in a problem. But then you have to let go of it, let your mind wander off and go do something else. It’s while you’re otherwise engaged, and not focused on the problem, that you will be rewarded with a eureka breakthrough. How to switch between these two modes—focus and lack of focus—is one of the most important things this book will teach you.
                    - “In my experience, eureka moments happen when we face a high level of pressure,” explains Victoria Spadaro-Grant, CTO of pasta behemoth Barilla and one of Olivia’s favorite clients, “whether the pressure is generated as a by-product of a self-imposed challenge or the result of external circumstances.”7
                    - When Barilla CEO Claudio Colzani, concerned by the increasing consumption of saturated fats reported by the World Health Organization, ordered a massive reduction in saturated fats across Barilla’s entire bakery portfolio, Spadaro-Grant faced a “massive challenge.” As head of Research and Development for the Barilla Group, she was in charge of reformulating the portfolio and bringing it to market within five months. “At the time, we did not know how to solve the technical challenge of delivering the same eating experience with less saturated fat, not to mention implementing new manufacturing processes and addressing the multimillion euro cost and profitability impact.”
                    - With the clock ticking, Spadaro-Grant assembled “a SWAT team of only six people who were eager to try, test, break rules, and make bold decisions. We realized that with such a short time frame, we had to throw the old rule book completely out the window. That realization led to new margins of tolerance across technical solutions, manufacturing setups, formulation costs, and marketing communications. As simple as this sounds, this was the way we changed technical paradigms about how to use fats in our bakery.” Eureka!
                - Metaphorical Breakthrough
                    - In 1782, there was no such thing as a bullet: guns did not shoot small, tapered missiles, but rather lumps of lead known as “shot.“ Most people produced shot by rolling out a sheet of molten lead, waiting for it to cool, and then chopping it up. This wasn’t very effective in producing smooth spheres: the projectiles were misshapen, pitted, or even completely perforated.
                    - As a result, it was nearly impossible for anyone to shoot straight. Because of their irregular shape, the slugs would catch the wind and curve like a paper airplane; their trajectory was always unpredictable. In 1782, hitting your target had more to do with luck than with aim. Since England was in the business of ruling the world at the time, and in the midst of a war with its pesky American colonies, the ability to shoot straight was of great interest.
                    - Producing shot was also expensive, time consuming, and labor intensive. After the chopping method, people tried pouring molten lead into spherical molds. Unfortunately, the cooling process tended to create off-center spheres, and in addition air bubbles left deep, random pits.
                    - Enter William Watts. A prosperous plumber living in a three-story house in the town of Bristol, England, Watts experienced a week of particularly troublesome sleep. Night after night he was puzzled by the same dream: He was walking along a street when it began to rain—only it wasn’t raining water, it was raining lead. The drops of lead piled up around his feet. When Watts bent down to pick one up, he saw that it was a perfectly round sphere, the ideal lead shot everyone was chasing after. Watts was dreaming about the perfect product falling from the sky. But what did it mean? Day after day he pondered that question in vain.8
                    - After a few days, tired from lack of sleep at night and from puzzling over the dream during the day, Watts went for a walk. As he went down the street he had a flash of insight and suddenly understood the meaning of his dream. He ran home and set to work.
                    - Watts added three floors to his house, making it six stories high. He cut holes in each floor, one atop the other, and put a water tank at the bottom. Then he stood at the top of this shaft with a copper sieve and a bucket of molten lead. He poured the liquid lead through the sieve and watched as lead droplets fell the length of the shaft, landing in the cool water below with a hiss.
                    - He ran downstairs, dipped his hand into the well, and pulled up a handful of beautifully round lead shot. The even pull of gravity in the stillness of the airshaft had produced perfect spheres. Watts had invented a process to make it rain bullets, turning his dream into reality. Patented in 1783, these “shot towers,” as they came to be known, sprang up all over England, Europe, and America.
                    - Watts’s mind had presented him with a solution indirectly: his brain came up with an analogy and shared it through a dream. Watts dreamed that he was walking in a rain of little lead pellets, had the same dream for a week without knowing what to make of it, then finally had a revelation, and the insight that his mind was trying to communicate became clear.
                    - Metaphorical insights aren’t as direct as eureka insights. Answers come to you first as metaphors or analogies, and you must interpret their images before the breakthrough is complete. With Archimedes’ eureka insight, the answer came fully formed. There was no need to interpret a metaphor: the submersion of his leg was a direct correlation to the submersion of the crown.
                    - If Watts’s insight had been a eureka insight, he would have seen a concrete solution: an image of a tower, of drops of metal falling and being shaped into spheres by friction with the air, landing in water, and cooling down. It would have been a one-to-one correlation. Instead, he had a dream about rain, and then saw that the drops of rain were drops of lead. It was raining lead. The elements were there: the lead, the fall, the water. But there wasn’t a direct correlation; a process of interpretation was necessary.
                    - Sometimes, your brain needs to work through various levels of comprehension before you can connect a wordless intuition to a real-life problem. Metaphor works like a wormhole: it can connect things that appear to be incredibly far apart, and it can overlay a pattern on things that appear to be unconnected. Unlike their eureka cousins, metaphorical breakthroughs can be had about subjects we’re barely familiar with, like a plumber having an insight about ammunition.
                    - Such insights are often embedded in bizarre dreams. Celebrated inventor Elias Howe dreamed that he was captured by a primitive tribe and held at spear point. Howe, admirably unperturbed in his dream, noticed that the spearheads had holes in them. Thus was discovered the secret to the lock stitch sewing machine—placing a hole on the pointy end of the needle. The improvement in stitching speed revolutionized the clothing industry.9
                    - This metaphoric type of insight is also the basis of a process known as biomimicry. In biomimicry, we look for designs already existing in nature that could be useful in a human context. You may have heard that Velcro was discovered by mimicking sticky burrs. But did you know that the tenacious, watertight glue that oysters and barnacles use to adhere to rocks has inspired new ways for surgeons to close wounds on human beings?10
                    - The Wright Brothers originally studied the flight of birds to gain insights into how to control powered flight. They noticed the birds twisted their wing tips to keep their balance. But on their lightweight plane, pivoting wing tips would be too fragile. Wilbur Wright, who owned a bicycle shop, had a long inner-tube box in his hands one day. He was absentmindedly twisting the box when the breakthrough suddenly came to him. If the entire wing twisted, you could control flight. His discovery came to be called “wing warping” and was the breakthrough that set the age of aviation in motion.11
                    - We have found metaphorical breakthroughs to be a powerful tool when working with leaders. The executive team of a very successful Silicon Valley company asked us to sit in on their meeting when they were facing a block. They had had great success with their core product but could feel their well-funded competitors breathing down their neck. Should they double down on what they were already doing and try to own the market, or should they expand into a more unknown, adjacent area?
                    - The executive team talked and talked. They used logic and linear arguments and lots and lots of words. Some argued they should stay with what they know. Their investors trusted them, their customers trusted them, and they’d spent a lot of time and money building their brand in that direction. Others argued that this was innovate-or-die time, that they had no choice but to spread their wings and fly into the unknown. That’s what made companies great. There was a not-so-subtle hint that the other side lacked the courage to be great. That did not go over well. Those arguing to stick with the known product dug in and made their same arguments only more forcefully. Around and around they went, all the time banging up against walls.
                    - Judah went up to the big whiteboard in the front of the room and drew two large boxes. He then split the executive team into their opposing groups, gave them pens, and ordered them to draw pictures of their visions of the future. At first there was grumbling and protests that they didn’t know how to draw. Olivia assured them that stick figures were perfectly acceptable. Slowly, the teams began to work.
                    - When the executives finished there was something striking about their two pictures: they weren’t very different. Both groups drew a road winding to the horizon, happy faces along the road, and signposts at certain intervals. The farther along the roads you went the more happy faces there were. At first everyone was confused. If their pictures were so similar, why were they arguing?
                    - As each team described their drawings the differences became crystal clear. One group drew bends in the road to represent how they’d have to react to the market. The other group drew bends in the road to represent how they wanted to get ahead of the market. The room got quiet for moment. A clarity had emerged. In this case the metaphor broke through the disagreement and posturing to reveal the essence of the issue. The group that wanted to stick with the core product and then react to the market saw clearly that they were reacting out of fear. The decision was made to move into the adjacent field. Three years on and the decision has proved a rousing success.
                    - Visual thinking is a common trait among breakthrough thinkers. Many of the people we interviewed carry small sketch pads with them at all times. When they first put their idea to paper it is often as an image or a series of images. Visual thinking accesses different parts of the brain than language and logical argument. And it can be even more powerful when you are not very good at drawing because it forces you to be less literal and more metaphorical.
                - Intuitive Breakthrough
                    - Imagine a dry lake bed in the high desert of California. This vast wasteland, offering little more than hard red earth, dust, and heat, was the spot the miltary had chosen in 1947 for its top-secret supersonic test flights. The plane being tested, the Bell X-1, was shaped like a bullet, with wafer-thin wings. The U.S. Air Force was experimenting with rocket planes to finally crack the sound barrier.
                    - Unfortunately, every time pilots got close to the speed of sound, their planes’ controls would freeze up, their rudders wouldn’t move, and they’d be tossed around as if flying through a storm. It wasn’t pretty: one plane completely disintegrated. The engineers were wringing their hands. No pilot had yet survived flying even 85 percent of the necessary speed, and the death toll was mounting.12
                    - Chuck Yeager, a country boy from West Virginia, was one of the air force’s very best pilots. At barely twenty-four years old, Yeager was already a legend. Thanks to his World War II exploits, he was known as an ace fighter pilot who seemed to have been born to fly.
                    - During practice runs, Yeager had experienced all the usual difficulties as he approached the speed of sound: loss of controls, the plane shaking and wobbling, the entire aircraft tossed around in the wind like a rag doll. And yet, despite this evidence, Yeager was convinced that the closer he got to the sound barrier, the easier flying would be.
                    - How could he be so sure? Aerospace engineering barely had a name yet, and he was up against PhDs who safely combined liquid oxygen, cooled to 297 degrees below zero, with ethyl alcohol, and then managed to contain the resulting explosion in a way that created propulsion. They were certain that they had run up against the limits of physics, and that flirting with the sound barrier was a suicide mission.
                    - Yet here was Yeager, the son of a gas driller, with only a high school education, certain that he could make it. He had nothing but an intuition, a hunch so strong he was willing to bet his life on it. He somehow knew it would work.
                    - On the fateful morning of October 14, 1947, Chuck Yeager climbed aboard the Bell X-1 and slid into the cockpit. He and his plane were dropped out of the belly of a converted B-29 bomber and rocketed straight up into the sky.
                    - As he approached .9 Mach (90 percent of the necessary speed), the plane tossed and rolled and the controls became unresponsive. But when he reached .96 Mach he informed the ground that he had regained control of the airplane. The country boy had out-predicted the PhDs.
                    - And then all of a sudden, the needle on the machometer fluctuated, then abruptly jumped clear off the scale. On the ground, they heard the famous “sonic boom.” Not only had the plane gotten easier to fly, once it got close enough, the plane simply leapt across the sound barrier.
                    - How did Yeager know? And how was he sure enough to risk his life? Intuitive breakthroughs defy logic or explanation. Most of the time, when people experience intuitive breakthroughs they don’t know why their solution will work, they just know that it will.
                    - Achieving a certain level of mastery in one’s line of work or craft opens the door to deep insights. Research fellow Tammy Sanders describes intuition as “a nebulous and inexplicable sense of knowing, flowing from expertise and guided by environmental cues.”13 This is the kind of insight that comes to tinkerers, model builders, and product designers. Without even realizing it, you’ve loaded up thousands of facts, experiences, and case studies over the course of your life, and they’re sitting in the back of your mind.
                    - Thomas Edison, the ultimate tinkerer, invented the phonograph with an intuitive breakthrough. As he tinkered with a prototelephone, on a whim, he touched a pinpoint to the vibrating diaphragm he was working with. He had an intuition that, as he spoke, the pinpoint would create indentations in the tinfoil beneath the diaphragm. When the pinpoint played back through the track in the tinfoil, it would vibrate the pin, reproducing the sound. He was right.14
                    - Although both eureka and intuitive breakthroughs are characterized by a sense of certainty, there is a finality to a eureka breakthrough; you’ve arrived at your goal. Intuitive breakthroughs, on the other hand, tend to be more of a beginning; they set you on the path toward the goal. Don’t expect a sudden flash of insight. You will, however, experience a quiet calming of the mind and body. It’s as though you were standing at a crossroads and suddenly just knew to take the road on the left.
                    - If you’re scratching your head, thinking that intuitive breakthroughs don’t sound like breakthroughs at all, they’re probably not your personal style of breakthrough. If, on the other hand, you read this section and felt truly understood, this might be your native breakthrough style.
                    - Do you have to be more confident to handle an intuitive insight than a eureka insight? Yes. You have to ascribe legitimacy to a feeling you can’t explain, rationalize, or prove.
                    - Leaders must communicate their intuitive breakthroughs clearly and concretely to gain appropriate support in their organizations. But intuition can be difficult to talk about.
                    - Two-star general Dana Pittard was the commanding officer of the army’s 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. He was in charge of forty thousand people and a massive amount of firepower. So it was odd for Judah, when working with the general and his staff, to hear whispers about the general planting “Charlie Brown Christmas trees” all over the post. Going on his own intuition, Judah asked about the Christmas trees.
                    - After an awkward silence, the general explained that one of his goals was to make Fort Bliss, an army post larger than the state of Rhode Island in the desert of west Texas, a zero-waste facility. Planting trees for soil and water retention as well as shade was part of that mission. It was at this point that the chief of operations said, “Sir, they just look sad along the side of the road. Like rows and rows of Charlie Brown Christmas trees.”
                    - Judah asked the general what he saw when he looked at the rows of sad little trees along the road. The general stared off for a few moments. And then it was as if he realized that no one else was seeing what he was seeing. He understood he needed to communicate his intuition.
                    - “I see those trees thirty years in the future. They’re spreading their leaves wide across the boulevards providing shade; their thick roots are traveling deep into the ground. Birds and squirrels are making their homes in the branches. As the leaves give off their moisture they cool the sidewalks so more people will walk.”
                    - As the general described the post of the future, his staff nodded their heads. But they still were not bought in. Judah could tell from the combination of the general’s conviction, yet still vague description, that he had had an intuitive breakthrough. He knew something about the future that went beyond his environmental concern; he just couldn’t quite communicate what it was. That’s the paradox of intuitive breakthroughs. There was something more to the general’s vision than a description of trees. But what was it?
                    - When the group reconvened, Judah asked General Pittard why he was focused on making Fort Bliss a zero-waste post. The general grew very animated. “That’s just it. Our military runs on energy, and right now that energy comes from oil. That dependence is a security risk, both from other countries and the environment. Don’t you see,” he said to his staff, “it’s not about the trees. We could have a more peaceful world, a more secure world in thirty years, by changing how we draw energy from the world. The trees are just a first step we can take right now in that direction.”
                    - General Pittard was trying to help the military see the inevitability and intelligence of going green. It was an intuitive idea. We may not know if it worked for another thirty years. But his explanation helped his staff understand what his intuition was about (though the Charlie Brown moniker stuck).
                    - Remember, no one style of breakthrough is better than another. Some people experience breakthroughs across multiple styles, and others have a deep relationship with just one. The key is to know which one or two are yours, and to work to cultivate those.
                - Paradigm Breakthrough
                    - The names associated with paradigm breakthrough are legendary: Newton, Einstein, Heisenberg, Darwin. This is the kind of breakthrough that affects all of humanity and changes the way we see the world.
                    - Paradigm breakthrough is a deep insight about a system of thought that fundamentally changes the rules we assign to that system. When Newton watched an apple fall to the ground and realized that the same force that pulled the apple down was also governing the heavenly bodies, he revolutionized a system.
                    - While eureka breakthroughs and paradigm breakthroughs both tend to arrive in a clear, straightforward fashion, they differ in the type of content they deliver. Paradigm breakthroughs will reveal a grand theory, universal laws, an explanation of multiple phenomena without any immediate concrete application. Eureka breakthroughs, on the other hand, deliver a concrete, immediately applicable answer to a specific problem.
                    - You’ll also feel different, physically and mentally, after experiencing these two types of breakthroughs. Eureka breakthroughs deliver a rush of excitement and newfound energy. We heard a story about a scientist who was driving off the NASA campus at the end of the day when a thorny problem suddenly resolved itself—a eureka breakthrough. He stopped his car in the middle of the road, got out, and ran back to his office.
                    - For the rest of the afternoon, his fellow NASA employees simply drove around his car on their way out, swerving extra wide to avoid the driver’s side door, which he had left open. Even if you’re a generally responsible person, having a eureka breakthrough will bring out the absentminded professor in you.
                    - Paradigm breakthroughs, although far greater in their impact, are a calmer personal experience. They may bring about a sense of awe and wonder rather than excitement. They might be immensely intellectually satisfying, but not necessarily valuable in the financial or practical sense. And they often require additional work to be fully developed, as in the case of Einstein’s theory of relativity, which was too complex to have “occurred” to him in its entirety in one moment. Einstein actually spent six whole weeks writing out his theory. The experience was more drawn out than we typically think necessary for breakthroughs, as if the magnitude of the idea was too much to take in all at once.
                    - Paradigm breakthroughs are the most rarely occurring type, and the most powerful. But they have as much to do with luck and timing as they have to do with a single person’s abilities. Einstein’s paradigm breakthrough came at the end of a long line of smaller breakthroughs going back at least a hundred years, from Alessandro Volta’s discovery and description of electrical properties to James Clerk Maxwell’s more precise definition of these properties to Albert Michelson and Edward Morley disproving the existence of aether and more accurately confirming the speed of light, to Ludwig Boltzmann defending the concept of atoms, and finally to Max Planck discovering the law of quanta.
                    - Every single one of these discoveries, these smaller breakthroughs, was a prerequisite for Einstein’s paradigm breakthrough. This series of breakthroughs is what Einstein was describing when speaking of his “earlier intellectual experience.”15 Einstein lived at a moment in history ripe for a paradigm shift. He truly “stood on the shoulders of giants.”
                    - This is not to take away from Einstein’s genius, but it’s important to recognize the role of external factors in creating a paradigm breakthrough. And while they may seem like the Holy Grail of breakthroughs, it’s something one should neither focus on nor strive after.
                    - The allure of the paradigm breakthrough is obvious. Everyone will know your name. Your face will adorn the walls of dorm rooms. But paradigm shifters don’t set out to shift paradigms—a lesson many innovators would do well to learn.
                    - Many people get lost down a rabbit hole chasing a paradigm-shifting idea. NASA scientist Peter Cheeseman talks about seeing colleagues go chasing after the essence of quantum mechanics and never returning. Artificial intelligence expert, serial entrepreneur, and angel investor Barney Pell calls the phenomenon “smart people, stupid problem.”16 Olivia’s scientist father recalls: “For the first ten years after my PhD, I was chasing the Nobel Prize and got nowhere. Then I gave up, and finally started doing good science.”
                    - Once again, it’s important to see the different types of breakthroughs as equally desirable, and you must trust the way your brain delivers a breakthrough to you.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - A breakthrough is a sudden advance in our knowledge or understanding that moves us past a barrier and allows us to see and understand something in a new way.
                    - Eureka breakthroughs are clear, sudden, fully formed, immediately applicable, and are most likely to arrive when you’re not thinking about a problem. They create great excitement in the individual experiencing one.
                    - Metaphorical breakthroughs usually arrive as metaphors or analogies and require interpretation before they’re complete. They are sometimes embedded in dreams, and occur as the brain connects two seemingly disparate items or ideas.
                    - Intuitive breakthroughs defy logic and explanation and tend to be more of a beginning. They allow us to make progress down a longer path.
                    - Paradigm breakthroughs arrive in clear, straightforward fashion, similar to eureka breakthroughs. However, these breakthroughs reveal a grand theory or explanation that is without any immediate application. They bring more awe and wonder than excitement. They are the rarest, but also the most powerful, type of breakthrough.
                    - No specific type of breakthrough is better or more productive than another, it’s simply a matter of knowing which type is most natural to you.
            - Chapter 2: The Chrysalis
                - Where Breakthroughs Come From
                - THE YEAR WAS 1965. The place was Clearwater, Florida. In his motel room—the Rolling Stones weren’t yet famous enough to afford hotels—Keith Richards woke up on a hot, humid morning to find his guitar and a tape recorder on the bed beside him. Groggy and hung over, Richards rewound the tape and pressed “play.” The hourlong tape contained fifty-nine minutes of his own snoring. But the first thirty seconds held the opening bars and first lyric of what became the Rolling Stones’s most iconic hit, the song “Satisfaction.”1 He didn’t remember even touching the tape recorder.
                - Believe it or not, Richards’s breakthrough moment follows the very same pattern as Einstein’s discovery of the special theory of relativity. It’s the pattern we heard again and again when we interviewed some of the world’s greatest innovators for this book. And it’s the same pattern you’ve experienced if you’ve ever had a sudden epiphany in the shower.
                - Whenever you have a “shower moment,” chances are something was on your mind, like a problem at work or an issue in a relationship. You’d probably been mulling over the problem, trying to work it out in different ways. Then you stepped into the shower. Your mind wandered off as the water poured over you. You were no longer focused. Suddenly, seemingly out of the blue, the answer came to you.
                - What do your shower moments have in common with both Keith Richards’s and Albert Einstein’s discoveries? When you got into the shower, you unknowingly switched brain modes. Previously, you had been consciously focusing on the problem. But in the shower, your mind was probably drifting, idly daydreaming or seemingly “thinking about nothing.” Neuroscientists have recently discovered that the secret to breakthroughs lies in our ability to switch between these two modes, the focused and the meandering.2
                - The focused mode is one you are already familiar with, because it’s the one you have been consciously using all your life. You can think of this mode as the “executive mode”: it’s the one you use to execute, to get things done. Goal-oriented and deadline-focused, it’s a champion at making lists, following timelines, and coming in under budget. The part of your brain responsible for this mode is called the executive network, or EN.3
                - The EN is a group of brain regions near the front of your skull that help you focus on a task and accomplish a specific goal. You’re very well versed in the use of your EN. You did, after all, spend at least a decade in school specifically training those brain regions. As a matter of fact, you’re using your EN right now to read this sentence.
                - The EN allowed our forebears to track the patterns of the stars and the moon, figure out the best time to plant their crops, and organize the immense task of building the pyramids. It’s also responsible for “social inhibition,” the form of self-control we use to function in society. Without your EN you are a three-year-old. With your EN you are (we hope) a functional, responsible, and productive member of society.
                - But your EN alone can’t create breakthroughs. It needs help from the more meandering network, the one that creates shower moments. This is our creative network, the default network, or DN. You can think of the DN as a network or council of breakthrough geniuses inside your brain. The geniuses talk and exchange ideas, half-baked theories, and wild speculations.
                - The DN is the source of all our creativity, all our invention, all our genius—and it hasn’t gotten nearly enough recognition. What has the DN accomplished throughout history? A better question would be what great discoveries hasn’t it played a role in. If the EN gives us the ability to focus and accomplish a task, the DN gives us the ability to look through the complexity of the world to see the patterns underneath.4
                - The DN is a vital component of your brain: research has made clear that this part of your brain is as essential to your survival as your heart or your kidneys.5 It’s so important, in fact, that we could have written this entire book all about the DN. We would have said, “Here it is! Here’s how it works, here’s how you can access it, here’s how you can turbocharge it.” But in fact, that’s not enough. The DN, alone, can’t create breakthroughs.
                - It’s the ability to use both modes, to switch from one mode to another, that enabled Keith Richards to come up with “Satisfaction” and Albert Einstein to discover the special theory of relativity. In fact, it’s what enabled most discoveries in human history.
                - We will cover how the DN works, how you can access it, and how you can turbocharge it. But we will then take you to the next level and teach you how to get both networks to work together—that is, how to switch from one mode to the other and back again. This “mode switching” is what it’s all about.
                - As your brain takes in information via your five senses, some of it is used in immediate circumstances, such as: step over that rock; hit the brakes; someone just walked into the room, so stop singing.
                - We also use information to build patterns. Some of the patterns are simple, such as: I like pizza from Marcello’s, or I don’t like it when my mother calls because she gives me guilt for not calling. These patterns are part of life’s basics, its essentials. (Especially with a Jewish mother. Trust us.)
                - Other patterns are more complex, such as: What is the series of notes, chords, and bars that will become a song that will electrify American rock and roll? Try as it might, this was not a pattern that Richards’s EN could figure out.
                - In 1965, on their first American tour, the Rolling Stones were a midlevel group touring the country with their fourth album. They were seriously in need of a breakthrough hit, the kind of number one song that would make them a household name. Richards’s EN knew this and had been focusing on it. His executive set a direction and defined a need, but it couldn’t come up with a solution.
                - When Richards fell asleep, his executive was able to take a break from its usual work of thinking and executing. Imagine it taking a walk from its front office in the brain to the deeper, central part of the brain. There’s a secret lounge there, where his council of breakthrough geniuses reside. We all have a lounge like that inside our brain.
                - While Richards’s executive was working in the brain’s front office, the lights in the genius lounge were dim, because when the EN is focused on accomplishing a specific task, it draws much of the brain’s power. But with the front office on break, the power is rerouted to the genius lounge, and when Richards’s executive opens the door, things are buzzing.
                - Imagine a lounge full of plush couches, beanbags, drinks and snacks, whiteboards and sticky notes and different colored pens and pencils. Leonardo da Vinci is sitting in a corner doodling on his sketch pad. Napoleon is playing with toy soldiers. Euclid is dancing with glow sticks that Marie Curie gave him. Michelangelo is wrapping Play-Doh around a pencil. Teresa de Avila is trying to write in her diary, but Erasmus keeps bothering her to ask about the fate of mankind. Steve Jobs is telling Einstein he’s not thinking big enough. Sun Tzu is telling a story of his past victory to no one in particular. Joan of Arc is ruminating over her betrayal by the French. Sherlock Holmes is analyzing the environment for clues (To what? It doesn’t matter. He just likes analyzing), and Amelia Earhart is taking a nap.
                - When it walks into the room, Richards’s executive asks for their attention. “Listen folks, we need a hit. See what you can come up with.” A direction is set, a need is defined. Then—and this is important—the executive heads out to do something else. It knows that it has to let the geniuses do their thing. Maybe it takes a walk, knits a sock, or takes a shower. It can’t be something too demanding, or it would draw brainpower away from the lounge.
                - Meanwhile, back in the lounge, the lights grow bright and the geniuses crank up the espresso machine. They are talking, writing, drawing, building Lego models of their theories, or putting sticky notes up and moving them around. Michelangelo and Leonardo are sketching, Sun Tzu and Napoleon are strategizing, Teresa de Avila and Erasmus are reflecting, Joan of Arc is worrying. (We’re not kidding, this is really what the different parts of your DN do.) The ideas are flying. One theory leads to another, which leads to another.
                - The executive regularly checks back in so that the geniuses can show it what they came up with. The executive might make some comments and suggestions or clarify the direction, and then go back to its crossword puzzle or daydream. Until one moment—during a walk, or in the shower, or in Richards’s case, in the middle of the night—when the geniuses get incredibly excited, and the executive sees something spark. Something has come together.
                - That night in Clearwater, Keith Richards’s genius council showed his executive the first eight bars of a song with a single lyric. The geniuses and the executive looked at it together, then looked at each other and said Yes! The executive woke Richards up, made sure he recorded it, and then went off-task again so Richards could go back to sleep.
                - And that, in a nutshell, is the neuroscience of breakthroughs.
                - Recapping the neuroscience of “Satisfaction”:
                    - The executive sets the direction: Write a hit song!
                    - Richards falls asleep; his executive leaves the front office.
                    - Power reroutes to the genius lounge; the brain has switched modes.*
                    - The geniuses come up with a song that the executive recognizes as a possible hit.
                    - The executive rouses Richards from sleep and makes sure he records the song.
                    - Task completed, Richards falls back asleep as his executive leaves the front office.
                - The executive, among many other things, sets the direction for your genius council to follow. And once the genius council has come up with something, the executive is the one that puts into practice the ideas the genius council comes up with. It’s as if the executive were giving the genius council a bunch of Legos and saying, “See what you can turn these into.” The Legos snap together the same way neurons do. Your genius council is constantly trying out new neural connections. Sometimes it makes a multicolored Lego mess, but sometimes it puts together a locomotive, a spaceship, or the special theory of relativity.
                - If the DN Is So Important, Why Haven’t You Heard of It Before?
                    - Since 1929, neuroscientists have known that the brain is in a constant state of activity, and that background noise surrounds our more rational processes, but only recently has that background noise been examined as anything more than a nuisance.6
                    - Our modern biases are geared toward the logical, the structured, the efficient—all the things that the DN is not. As the DN’s discoverer, Dr. Marcus Raichle, told us, “Up until recently, our focus has been on making the brain do specific things, ignoring the background, default, nonconscious, nondirected activity.”7 The default network is one of the most powerful tools at our disposal, but it is not task focused.
                    - Focus is a positive attribute: a bias for the executive is a bias for what is feasible. But the top performers, the stars, the innovators, the geniuses reach breakthroughs by switching back and forth between the focused EN and the unfocused DN.
                    - Dr. Raichle, who discovered the existence of the default network in 1997, named it thus because it is the mode that the brain defaults to anytime it isn’t on-task. And this mode never actually shuts off, but rather quiets down when we are focused on something. The moment we switch off a task, we default to this network. Look out the window, bang! Default to the network. Get up to make coffee, bang! We default to the network.
                    - Dr. Raichle told us that this unconscious processing “is truly most of what we really do; because if we didn’t we’d be pretty hopeless.” The network is always on, always engaged, interrupted only when we have to perform a specific task. And this is why it uses twenty times more energy than the conscious, task-focused part of the brain.8
                    - “The brain is active all of the time,” Dr. Raichle told us, “whether you are awake or asleep, whether you’re engaging in a particular task or you are daydreaming. The brain is operating almost at full capacity or full strength pretty much all of the time.”
                    - Unfortunately we are so busy—we have so many tasks to complete to do our jobs, hit our numbers, achieve our goals—that we leave less and less time for our genius council to work its magic. We live in an executive world, which makes it all the more difficult for us to sit still and let power reroute to the genius lounge. But the genius council’s participation is essential to breakthrough thinking.
                    - In the mid-1800s, chemists were trying to discover the structure of the molecule benzene, a key component in gasoline. German chemist Friedrich August Kekulé set his executive to the task. But it was one night while dozing off in front of a fire, having switched off his executive mode, that his genius council drew him a picture of a snake eating its own tail.9
                    - Kekulé’s genius council had given him the metaphor; his executive interpreted the metaphor and solved the riddle: benzene was a ring. With that, Kekulé ushered in the modern age of structural organic chemistry and the rise of the pharmaceutical industry. Ever wonder why so many big pharmaceutical companies are German: Merck, Bayer, Roche, Schering? Kekulé set up his breakthrough lab at the University of Bonn.
                    - Kekulé, like Einstein, Edison, Dalí, Tesla, Watts, and countless other innovators, achieved his breakthrough thanks to the back-and-forth switch between his executive mode and his genius mode. In fact, Dr. Raichle told us that it was after leaving a meeting and walking down the hall that he had the breakthrough leading to the default network’s discovery.
                    - So how can you access your genius mode?
                - Sleep on It (Yes, Really)
                    - Adam Cheyer is the creator of Siri, Apple’s artificial intelligence iPhone voice assistant. Building Siri was a Herculean design and programming task. The sheer number of variables—the ability to understand varying speech patterns, the ability to search based on the random ways people would request information, the ability to return answers in a useful way—were each a massive challenge in its own right. Thankfully, Cheyer had a secret weapon: ready access to his genius mode.
                    - Although designing and building Siri was a highly structured task, Cheyer knew better than to try to logically grind out every answer. Instead, he told us, “I sleep on the issues I’m wrestling with.”10 Cheyer, like Dalí and Edison, has discovered the incredible breakthrough power of the hypnagogic and hypnopompic states, the half-asleep periods just before falling asleep and just before waking. These are times when our genius council runs on hyperdrive.
                    - “I go to bed around eleven, noodling on a problem as I fall asleep,” he explained. By “noodling” on the problem, Cheyer uses his EN to deliberately and consciously focus his genius council on a question.
                    - He relies on his genius council to make new associations and deliver breakthroughs while asleep. In the morning he goes to his desk and uses his EN to process the night’s harvest of ideas.
                    - Morning after morning while first designing Siri, he would wake up with new insights from his DN. He’d use his EN to integrate them into the prototype he was building. Eventually, he felt that he had something concrete enough to show the rest of the world.
                    - The hypnagogic and hypnopompic states are so fruitful for creativity because our inhibiting frontal lobes—where our EN’s front office is located—are quiet, and our DN is running strong.11
                - Falling Asleep: Accessing Your Hypnagogic State
                    - The hypnopompic state is the brief period of time just as you’re waking up, while the hypnagogic state is a similarly brief period of time just as you’re falling asleep.
                    - Putting It into Practice: How to Enter the Hypnagogic State
                        - Clear the room of clutter and distractions.
                        - Have pen and paper, voice recorder, your phone on airplane mode and set to take notes, or . . .
                        - Dim the lights (or wear an eye mask).
                        - Ensure you’re in a quiet place, or that only white noise is audible.
                        - Don’t get too comfortable—no wearing pajamas or getting in bed.
                        - Try to find time at midday, or right after you’ve eaten, when you’re just the right amount of tired.
                        - Set your alarm for ten to fifteen minutes.
                        - Take a moment to focus your brain on the problem, and then let it go. Relax and drift off.
                    - You’ll have better luck with the hypnagogic state if you do some prep work. Sifting through memories of your problem, partial solutions, the contours of your question, and the relevant information you have before you go to sleep is important. It’s up to you to set a direction for your brain to wander in. It is as if there were a reception desk in your brain saying, “Welcome to hypnagogic state. What would you like your geniuses to ponder?” You answer the question by thinking about the problem.
                    - Have a pad and pencil or a phone voice recorder nearby, but no other distractions—nothing to get in the way of your recording whatever information comes from the hypnagogic state, whether it’s in the form of words or an image.
                    - Dim lighting can help, too. When you’re having an insight, your visual cortex goes into alpha waves—that is, your brain actually ceases to process visual information. In order to support the breakthrough ability of the hypnagogic state, you want to enable your visual cortex to go off line unimpeded, and low lighting is just the thing.
                    - We recommend blocking the light rather than turning it off entirely simply because you might need the light to write, and you want to do as few things as possible between waking up and recording your ideas. You might try wearing an eye mask; this will block the light but will be fast and easy to remove, allowing you to begin recording your breakthrough almost immediately.
                    - Sound can be a matter of personal preference. Some people will want to eliminate all sound; others may prefer white noise, a fan, nature sounds, or the television on low volume.
                    - Research strongly indicates that a midday nap enhances most people’s cognitive abilities for the rest of the day, and that we get the most benefits from naps that last fifteen to twenty-five minutes. So if you try this exercise and don’t awaken with a breakthrough, you’ll at least be sharper and more productive for the rest of the day.*
                    - Don’t get frustrated if you find you’re not actually falling asleep: first, it might take some practice; and second, breakthroughs often come while relaxed and mind-wandering but not asleep.
                - Waking Up: Accessing the Hypnopompic State
                    - Deep sleep is not only allowed but required to access the hypnopompic state, so fluff those pillows and climb under the blanket. This is the state between rising out of sleep and coming into consciousness.
                    - Presumably, hours will have passed since you fell asleep the night before, so it’s imperative that you sent your brain in the right direction.
                    - Putting It into Practice: How to Access the Hypnopompic State
                        - Watch a documentary on something you know nothing about. Thinking about new narratives will trip new neural circuits and help your brain form new associations.
                        - Look through old photos. Your DN might find something valuable in a memory file that you’d forgotten years ago.
                        - Read a book from your adolescence. Old thoughts and feelings will come rushing in.
                        - Take a walk outside. You’ll simultaneously oxygenate your brain, flip the script on your bedtime routine, and see and feel things more interesting than your bathroom.
                        - Choose a progressive alarm that starts out quietly and builds in volume. You don’t want to be jolted awake, bypassing the liminal state you were trying to take advantage of. Nature sounds work well here.
                        - Have a recording device nearby, whether to write, type, or record your voice. The breakthroughs emerging from the hypnopompic state can be fleeting and ephemeral, so if you don’t record them, they’ll retreat from you as you wake up.
                    - It’s hard to ignore the number of creative geniuses who credit their successes to the hypnopompic state. “Half the time I get answers in the middle of the night,”12 said Jeff Hawkins, who started the entire smartphone revolution when he created the Palm and Treo and is now working on Grok, an artificial-intelligence system based on how our brain’s neurons actually work. “I think about it while falling asleep, and in the middle of the night I’ll wake up and I’ll lie in bed silently in the dark and just think. It’s very important that it is dark. And then the answer will just come to me.”
                    - Sleep is a great tool for accessing your genius mode. Judah has often awoken with great new ideas. He will often finish a conversation with a client by saying, “Alright, I’ll have an answer in the morning.” His clients often find an answer in their e-mail in-box over breakfast. Olivia, on the other hand, has never woken up with a new insight. When she naps, she rises groggy, hungry, and slightly grumpy. If she fell asleep with marbles in her hand, when they inevitably dropped, bounced, and rolled on the ground, she’d probably startle awake thinking “What idiot is making such a bloody noise?” So don’t beat yourself up if the hypnagogic and hypnopompic states don’t do much for you.
                    - We made great use of this technique when we worked with a successful start-up’s secret skunkworks design studio. One day the small team faced a particularly vexing design challenge. As the energy wound down, Judah opened a few beers to signal a shift. Once everyone had relaxed a little, Olivia tried to casually frame the problem.
                    - “So it seems like you all are trying to figure out how to use superlow bandwidth to create connectivity without cell towers. Does that sound about right?” It did not sound right and the group made sure to be very clear about what the issue was. And that was precisely what we needed them to do: at the very end of the day, they clearly defined the problem they were working on.
                    - That night we sent texts to a few of the team members just before bed to help their ENs focus their DNs before sleep. We framed the problem just as they had earlier. This is more than telling someone to sleep on it. The creation of the clear and concise framing along with focus before sleep is key. We acted as the executives to set the direction for the team’s genius lounges. The next morning, one of the engineers showed up with eyes shining. The solution had come to her as she woke up.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - Our brains have two modes of operation: focused mode and meandering mode.
                    - Focused mode is the executive mode that helps us get things done and is powered by the executive network (EN) of the brain. The EN is goal and action oriented.
                    - Meandering mode is the source of creativity and invention, and is powered by the default network (DN) of the brain. The DN is always running in the background, 24/7.
                    - Both modes are required for breakthroughs, and therefore we must learn to switch back and forth between them.
                    - The minutes just before and after sleep can be a fertile environment for breakthroughs. Falling asleep allows us to access DN solutions in the hypnagogic state. Waking from sleep allows us to discover DN solutions through the hypnopompic state.
            - Chapter 3: On the Hunt
                - How to Access Genius Mode
                - IMAGINE A PARTY inside your brain where all your ideas, memories, predictions, feelings, and environmental cues are meeting each other, making small talk, inviting new ideas into the conversation, excusing themselves to go to the bar for another drink, bumping into a new idea on the way to the bathroom, excitedly talking and dancing with each other. That, essentially, is what happens inside your genius lounge.
                - In this chapter, we’ll give you tools to make ideas collide with each other and spark breakthroughs.
                - Unfortunately, as anyone who zones out all the time can testify, simply taking a break will not lead to inspiration: to stoke creativity, you need to perform tasks that allow your mind to wander.1
                - After an “unusual uses” creativity test (“How many things can you do with a hanger?”) students were given a twelve-minute break. One group simply rested; one did an easy, mindless task; one did a demanding memory game; and one group took no break.
                - When the participants reconvened and retook the creativity test, the “mindless task” group performed an average of 41 percent better. By contrast, participants in the other three groups showed no improvement.
                - Interestingly, this was only the case for problems that were already being mentally chewed on; doing a mindless task didn’t seem to lead to a general increase in creative problem-solving ability. This makes sense: our executive has to have set a clear goal for our geniuses in order for them to be productive.
                - Where Butterflies Live
                    - Let’s say that you’re hard at work finishing a report. You feel there’s something missing but you don’t know what it is. You can’t quite make the connection. You could stare blankly at the wall, try to catch up on e-mail, or call a friend who’s been guilt-tripping you about returning their voice mail. Or you could allow your executive to wander by performing an undemanding task: water your plants, walk around the building, or make a sandwich. All three have the possibility of helping you get to breakthrough.
                    - When your executive is “distracted” with low-pressure activities, your genius lounge can draw more brainpower.2
                    - Science researchers in the field of creativity now recommend the regular inclusion of “mindless” work (i.e., work that is low in both cognitive difficulty and performance pressures) into the standard workday model as a critical component of high-creativity output. Their research suggests that to enhance creativity among chronically overworked professionals, their schedules should alternate between bouts of cognitively challenging, high-pressure work and bouts of mindless work.3
                    - Putting It into Practice: Mindless Activities We Recommend
                        - Doing puzzles or walking labyrinths
                        - Watching a movie you’ve already seen countless times
                        - Throwing a rubber ball against the wall
                        - Watching sunlight through the trees
                        - Staring out the window
                        - Running
                        - Washing dishes by hand
                        - Playing video games
                        - Folding laundry
                        - Cleaning a cluttered space
                        - Drawing, doodling, or using an adult coloring book
                        - Cooking a meal you’ve cooked many times before
                    - You could also listen to music. If you play an instrument, then by all means go for it, but give your mind a chance to meander by choosing a song you know incredibly well. The music will open your brain into an associative state, while your familiarity with the song will allow you to focus less on the task at hand.4
                    - For those of us who are not musicians, just listening to music turns on a host of brain circuits, and listening with headphones helps to block out the outside world. You can sit on your couch, lie down on the floor, or go out for a run. Any music will work as long as it is without lyrics. Sorry, pop-song-loving runners: even if you know the lyrics backwards, they will still grab hold of the verbal part of your brain and activate the EN.
                    - If at any point you feel blocked, stymied, frustrated at your lack of progress, walk away from your desk and start any of the above activities. Each of them will get your executive out of the front office and reroute the power to your genius lounge. The espresso is on and the associating begins.
                    - Try this: Walk to a newsstand or open your computer. Pick a magazine or Web site you’d never usually read. If you usually get Golf Digest, get a knitting or architecture magazine. If you’re into fashion, buy Forbes. Take in information unrelated to the challenge in front of you.5 You’ll be amazed at how quickly an unexpected train of thought can appear and start to snowball.
                    - Olivia sometimes finds herself absentmindedly staring at her vacuuming robot while it cleans the house. Her conscious mind is idly wondering where the robot will go next and trying to predict the patterns. But in the back of her mind, she can often feel her genius council churning away. Although this completely negates the intended time-saving aspect of the device, it’s very beneficial for breakthroughs.
                    - It’s not always easy to switch out of our focused, executive mode.
                    - Serena was a social entrepreneur with a company dedicated to eradicating the lung diseases caused by dusty and muddy floors in Africa. She was driven by her sense of purpose and yet kept asking herself whether it was okay to spend all her time building her company. Shouldn’t she be making more time to meet a nice man and start a family? It seemed everyone put this question to her, from her mother to her coworkers to her investors. The question acted as a weight and drain on her cognitive load.
                    - Judah knew the answer to this question lay deeper inside her than she was comfortable going. He needed to help her access her genius council. But someone as driven as Serena, especially when driven by purpose, would not set her executive to the side easily. He needed to provide her executive with an easy goal to occupy it so that the power would reroute to her genius lounge.
                    - At the retreat where we met her, there was a labyrinth made from stones. A labyrinth is not a maze. Rather, a labyrinth lays out a single path to follow. Once you enter it, there are no choices for you to make. All you have to do is follow the contours of the path as it winds its way inexorably toward the center. The path gives your executive just enough to focus on, while the lack of choices leaves plenty of excess power to reroute to the genius lounge.
                    - Judah set Serena at the start of the labyrinth. He then gave her executive a little help by focusing it on the question: “Are you unhappy devoting your life to your work? Do you feel something is missing?” He then ushered her into the labyrinth with a single command: “Walk slowly.” By the time Serena reached the center her shoulders had relaxed and her brow had unfurrowed. “I’m happy devoting my life to my work,” she said. “It’s everyone else who has an issue.”
                    - Afterward, Judah asked Serena what had happened. She said she wasn’t quite sure. She was walking the path of the labyrinth looking at the stones and the leaves on the ground. She was wondering at what degree the path curved. Then she said she felt like she just “spaced out. Like I was just walking. And then I knew. I knew.” Serena had a eureka breakthrough.
                    - Serena was able to return to building her company with all her energy and dedication and no more doubts nipping at her heels. They were other people’s doubts, not hers. She wanted to have an impact on the world through her work.
                    - One of the most interesting ways to let your mind wander is to watch something that is happening in real time. One attraction at the Museum of Modern Art that had people spellbound was a real-time representation of communication patterns between New York and the rest of the world, created by MIT. You can see it at senseable.mit.edu/nyte/visuals.html. Picture it in your mind right now: you’re looking at a dark globe, with jets of light emanating from New York to the rest of the world as the city’s inhabitants make phone calls. You’re seeing exactly what is happening, in the moment, right now. Fascinating, right?
                    - Now, imagine this exact same representation with a year’s delay. What you’re seeing on the globe is what happened twelve months ago. You will most likely feel your level of interest drop considerably. There is a fascination with the immediate that catches the EN, while letting the DN wander.
                    - “So what’s the single best mindless activity I can do?” our clients often ask us. For once, we have a straightforward answer: if we had to choose one single mindless activity for you to do, it would be walking.
                - Take a Walk
                    - In a recent study, participants walking indoors on a treadmill facing a blank wall or walking outdoors in the fresh air produced twice as many creative responses compared to those who were sitting down.6
                    - “I thought walking outside would blow everything out of the water,” said the lead researcher, “but walking on a treadmill in a small, boring room still had strong results.” The study also found that creative juices continued to flow even when a person sat back down shortly after a walk. “We know walking meetings promote creativity, but walking before a meeting may be nearly as useful.”7
                    - From a cognitive angle, walking demands just the right amount of focus from our executive, without asking too much. Walking is a very complex task: we are taking in constant input from our feet, legs, hips, arms, and, of course, our inner ears, the heart of our balance gyroscope. But our brains are experts at this task. Through long familiarity, the executive can do all this with very little energy.8
                    - From a physical angle, walking stimulates your brain. Increased blood flow causes a cascade of wonderful changes in the brain, including the release of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and other growth factors. BDNF promotes the birth of new neurons and the formation of new synapses, and it also strengthens existing synapses.9
                    - Open offices have strong detractors as well as proponents, but with their few inner walls and rolling tables, they’re at least walker friendly. In fact, according to research out of Stanford, the most important thing these open spaces offer to creativity is the ability to walk. Doing so increased a person’s creative output by 60 percent, the study found.10
                    - Darwin famously had a quarter-mile-long walking path called the Sandwalk that was his place to go and think when working on a problem. “So important was walking to his thought processes that Darwin sometimes described a problem he was working on in terms of the number of turns around his path he would need to solve it.”11
                    - Mason Currey, after studying the habits of nearly two hundred of the world’s most prolific inventors and innovators over the ages, found that the single common habit of these great inventors and innovators was walking. As Currey reports, Charles Dickens famously took three-hour walks every afternoon—and what he observed on them fed directly into his writing.
                    - Tchaikovsky made do with a two-hour walk, but wouldn’t return a minute early, convinced that cheating himself of the full 120 minutes would make him ill. Beethoven took lengthy strolls after lunch, carrying a pencil and paper with him in case inspiration struck.
                    - Søren Kierkegaard is quoted as saying “I have walked myself into my best thoughts.” He is also reported to have often rushed back to his desk and resumed writing, still wearing his hat and carrying his walking stick or umbrella.12
                    - Immanuel Kant would take a walk around the town square every day at the same time.
                    - Werner Heisenberg wrote about long, exhausting conversations every night with Niels Bohr as they tried to wrestle with the strange realities of quantum mechanics that “ended almost in despair.”13
                    - At the end of each of these nights Heisenberg went for a walk alone in the neighboring park all the time asking himself the same question: Could nature really be as absurd as it seemed in his experiments? When Heisenberg came up with his uncertainty principle, now the second most famous and influential scientific theory of the twentieth century, he was walking through the park on his way home.14 Textbook mind-wandering.
                    - Walking, when used for mind-wandering, works well in quiet, peaceful places; less well when you have to be aware of cars, traffic lights, joggers, and so forth, because your executive mode has to stay active. Whether to meander or to walk with purpose is up to you: Judah is comfortable walking aimlessly, but Olivia needs a route and a destination.
                    - Here’s the thing: you don’t just take a walk and magically have a breakthrough. Walking is a wonderful way to set the conditions, but there is more to it than simply meandering along.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Creative Walking
                        - Define your problem. The act of verbalizing what you’re looking for can get you started on finding the answer.
                        - Review your raw material. Read over the latest information you’ve collected. Check all the random Post-its and slips of paper you’ve jotted notes on, or any digital equivalent.
                        - Set a goal. Are you going to walk till you break through the blockage, or just for a set period of time or to a destination?
                        - Pay attention. It’s fine to space out a bit, but don’t neglect the scenery entirely.
                        - Carry a notebook. Always have a way to record your thoughts on hand.
                        - Keep something in your hand. A coin, a stone, a paper clip, a Star Wars figurine—we won’t judge. Our hands send massive amounts of information to our brains, and keeping those channels open keeps our brains in a more associative state. Adam Cheyer always keeps a Rubik’s Cube on his desk to play with while thinking.
                        - Stop and write it down. Don’t enjoy the moment of insight so much that you keep playing with it in your head. Few things are as frustrating as forgetting a brilliant thought.
                - Experiment with Your Environment
                    - The stereotypical image of the mad genius with a messy desk exists for a reason: creative mode is messy. Mess is good for creativity—in fact, it might sometimes be necessary, or as one of our favorite collaborators put it, “Messy is nessy.”
                    - Wouldn’t you find it more enjoyable to rummage through a chaotic pile of Legos than to be presented with a box of neatly organized pieces? Most of us instinctively want to dump all the Legos into a pile and jumble them together. Minimalism is great for productivity but not for creativity.
                    - One inventor was known to have two very different working rooms; one was Spartan, with almost no stimuli, the other a Wonka-esque madhouse to stimulate creativity. Many tech companies have playrooms for their employees, with grown-up toys like woodworking equipment. What you’re aiming for is a contained mess, to stimulate creativity but not hinder productivity.
                    - One very creative young innovator told us he regularly goes through cycles of rearranging everything in his apartment, creating a new environment—disturbing, then reordering, and after a little while doing it all over again. (It drives his roommates insane.)
                    - Putting It into Practice: Change Your Environment
                        - Put up prisms, which combine the advantages of light, color, and motion.
                        - Bring nature indoors by filling your creative space with natural elements such as plants, rocks, a small fountain, light, and so on.
                        - Climb a tree. Yes, we’re serious. You probably haven’t done it in some time, and that’s exactly why you should do it. Seeing the world from a weird angle is surprisingly helpful in unlocking a new perspective.
                        - If you live in a city, go to the top of a tall building and look out. If your building has windows in public spaces, go up and look out from there. Borrow a colleague’s office that looks out a different side of the building than yours. Stare out the window with the new view and notice the differences. How are the streets laid out? What are the trees like? Where are the bodies of water? How would you have designed the city differently?
                    - With all these suggestions, as always, your mileage may vary. Your aim is to find the balance of stimuli that works for you. Olivia likes to reflect on train journeys. The continuously unfolding scenery provides her with something to gaze at while her mind wanders, or fresh stimuli in case her mind gets stuck, but not so much that it is distracting. In addition, being a passenger is a receptive rather than active state, with no immediate action to take and no responsibilities, unlike driving, for example, so it’s easier to let your mind wander.
                    - Some people get their best ideas when on planes, others in the shower, others while gardening, running, or sitting still. Some may want to draw, others watch a movie, read something random, or cook. Some people will look out on a vista or the ocean, others may go to a forest. Some will want to walk the beach, others will want to sit with their back against a tree.
                    - The really important thing is to figure out where you tend to get your breakthroughs, and to put yourself in those environments more often.
                    - We often assume that sitting still or performing a repetitive motion like running is the key. But not always. Katashi, a senior vice president at a marketing firm, was trying to figure out what to do with a difficult campaign in Japan. Katashi was a bundle of energy. He talked fast and walked faster. His energy kept his team in a state of agitation.
                    - We knew that telling Katashi to stare out the window or sit under a tree was not going to work. We also knew that he had grown up playing baseball. He had even thought about playing professionally in Japan.
                    - One day we took the whole team to Central Park. Olivia gathered the other members of the team and led them on a wander through the part of the park called the Ramble. She motioned toward trees or benches where people could sit and go quiet. Judah stayed with Katashi and pulled out a reaction ball. It’s a hard rubber ball with eight round protrusions and it’s used as a training device in baseball. When you throw the reaction ball on the ground it takes crazy bounces, mimicking a baseball taking a bad hop.
                    - Judah stood fifty feet away from Katashi and began to throw the reaction ball at him. Katashi assumed the crouched stance of an infielder. A big smile spread across his face. As the ball hit the ground and veered all over the place, Katashi chased after it, sometimes making spectacular grabs, sometimes getting hit in the shin, sometimes missing it altogether.
                    - Nothing about this activity suggested his genius lounge was getting the energy it needed. But Katashi was so energetic that the activity worked. At one point he stopped and let the ball go right by him. He looked up and said, “That’s it.”
                    - There are no right ways to do this. You have to find your way.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Play with Your Physical Surroundings
                        - Right now, find five colors you enjoy around you.
                        - Touch textures till you find five you find enjoyable.
                        - Find five different hand movements. Go ahead, we’ll wait. Just do different things with your hands.
                    - Your environment, of course, isn’t just what you see; it’s also what you hear. Here are two exercises to experiment with your auditory environment.
                    - Visualize the music: As you listen to a piece of classical music, imagine a story to go along with it. Is a young hero leaving his small village and encountering pirates and maidens and sea monsters? Is the piece describing the emotional breakdown of an old man after the loss of his wife? (The Disney movie Fantasia was written this way.)
                    - Change the soundtrack: This one is Judah’s favorite, and it’s based on an old film trick by Sergei Eisenstein, a master of Russian film. Play a song while watching a movie scene on mute. Nine times out of ten, Judah says, the music will match the scene so well it’s spooky. During an off-site meeting for the drug company Genentech, one executive suggested pairing the final scene from the movie Casablanca with “We Are the Champions” by Queen. The experience sparked a conversation about pairing researchers with artists and musicians to help them visualize the chemical structures of key molecules to improve drug delivery.
                    - Putting It into Practice: The Best Background Noises for Creative Work
                        - An app called Coffitivity recreates the ambient noise of a coffee shop. (The creators originally set out to test the effect of background noise on productivity levels.)
                        - If you’re stuck doing repetitive work, binaural-beat tracks—which play slightly different frequencies into your right and left ear—can help you through the laborious implementation necessary to turn an insight into reality.
                        - Try electronic music, which features gradually building “narratives” of repeated base melodies.
                        - The chug-chugging of a train and the churning of a washing machine are incredibly soothing. You can find countless clips online.
                        - For a choice of ambient sounds try the Web site ASoftMurmur.com. It gives you choices that you can mix and match, like rain and thunder, or waves and wind, or waves and rain.
                    - When you want a fresh insight on a problem, you can also change your social environment. You could run the idea by different nationalities, age groups, or social classes. This is why travel is such a powerful provider of epiphanies: you are surrounded with all new stimuli. Traveling provides a completely different environment in many ways: physical, auditory, social, and so forth.
                    - Interaction exponentially increases your associative power. Just like you, other people’s brains bounce between different memories and facts, relating random facts to new endeavors. By sharing your associative ideas with other people, they have a chance of making an association you never would have thought of.
                    - On the other hand, breakthroughs come most often when you’re alone: it’s hard to dedicate the majority of your brainpower to your internal genius council when other people are around. As with everything else, the best ratio of solo to social time is different for each person. You need to find what works for you.
                    - Albert Einstein considered long walks on the beach to be imperative “so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head.”15 The need for solitude seems to be understood by many of the “greats.” Mozart said that it was only when he was entirely alone, whether “traveling in a carriage or walking after a good meal or during the night when I cannot sleep” that his best ideas flowed most abundantly.16
                    - Nikola Tesla, inventor of the alternating current that powers our lives, asserted that: “The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. . . . Be alone—that is the secret of invention: be alone, that is when ideas are born.”17
                    - For the greatest possible change of environment, consider experimenting with your psychological environment: become someone or even something else.
                    - A few cutting-edge techniques such as “bodily resonance” can actually simulate this experience. In a fascinating study, researchers used the “rubber hand illusion” to create a greater sense of kinship in people.18 Light-skinned Caucasian participants were given multisensory stimulation to experience a dark-skinned hand as belonging to them. The more the participants came to experience the dark-skinned hand as their own, the more positive their attitude toward people of another race became. By expanding what people could see and feel as part of their own body, the researchers were able to change their mindset.
                    - The rubber hand illusion can go quite far: you can even “become” an object. People were able to “become” a spoon and feel real empathy for it, even reflexively wincing when it was hit with a hammer!
                    - Putting It into Practice: Change Your Psychological Environment
                        - Watch a documentary about a topic you’d consider “random.” Try to find connections to what you are currently working on. How is this new world of bourbon distillers in rural Kentucky in any way similar to your project on marketing lip balm?
                        - Spend the day dressed like someone else. If you’re usually a casual dresser, wear a suit. If you wear a suit every day, try wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts. How do you feel different, knowing that you’re being perceived differently? (Our clothes are an element of our psychological environment. Several studies have shown that participants’ confidence and concentration levels were boosted by wearing a doctor’s white lab coat.)19
                        - For the next twenty minutes, give in to your first impulse. Just do whatever you feel like doing.* Harder than you thought, right? We are constantly stopping ourselves from doing all kinds of things.
                - Constraints Will Set You Free
                    - Creative constraints are what allow you to change your creative environment. Perhaps the most famous (and, unfortunately, probably apocryphal) story of creative constraints was a bet writer Ernest Hemingway made with friends that he could write an entire story in just six words.
                    - How could one possibly introduce characters, explain their relationships, awaken the reader’s emotions, and tell a story in just six words? Hemingway did so in one sentence:
                    - For sale: baby shoes, never worn.
                    - When Steve Jobs told the designer of the very first Apple mouse that it had to fit in his hand, work on any surface including his jeans, and cost less than fifteen dollars, he was setting creative constraints.20
                    - You can also use time constraints, as in setting a deadline. Some people can be creative on deadline, and many have to be. For many people, work expands to fill the time available, so deadlines help bring focus. “In the software industry,” explains engineer Kevin Sauer, part of Microsoft’s Black Belt team, “we use what we call iterations or sprints to focus what we are working on at any given time. I personally have experienced how when making these iterations very short (like a week), our teams were hyperfocused and accomplished more than some of the traditional two-week or even one-month sprints. A week is an absurdly short timeline, so the absurdity lowers the stakes. A hundred percent perfection is not on the table, so we are free from fear of failure.”21
                    - How can you experiment with constraints? You can constrain the time you have to do something, the space you have to do it in, or the resources you have: materials or money.
                    - Our dear friend and creativity expert Tina Seelig, a founding faculty member of Stanford’s famous Institute of Design, known as the D-school, was teaching a one-week class to help students understand the general principles of entrepreneurial thinking.
                    - She handed each student an envelope with what they only knew as their “initial funding.“ She told them they had four or five days to plan, but once they opened the envelope, they had two hours to make as much money as they could.
                    - When they opened the envelopes, they saw they each had five dollars. As Seelig explains it, the teams that made the most money didn’t bother using the five dollars. They realized that five dollars framed the problem way too tightly.
                    - One team set up a stand in front of the student union. They offered to measure bicycle tire pressure for free and fill tires for a dollar. About an hour in they realized people were super appreciative and so they pivoted and stopped charging a dollar and instead accepted donations. People donated even more. They walked away with a few hundred dollars. Another team made reservations at many of the popular restaurants in Palo Alto and sold their reservations as the times came up.
                    - But the team that made the most money sold the three-minute presentation time they had in class to a company that wanted to recruit Stanford students. They realized that three minutes was the most valuable thing they had. The lesson here is that we often perceive constraints where there are none.
                    - When filming Apocalypse Now, the director Francis Ford Coppola expected his star, Marlon Brando, to show up on set emaciated in order to play the character of Colonel Kurtz. Instead, Brando showed up overweight. So Coppola filmed Brando constantly in shadow. The audience could almost never get a clear look at him. Although this was done to hide the fact that he was too heavy, its effect was to make Kurtz even more menacing. The decision was praised as one of the director’s best in the movie.22
                    - Seelig uses the example from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, where the knights do not ride horses because the production could not afford horses. Instead, the knights pretend-gallop through the forest while their servants follow making the sound of horses’ hooves with two coconut shells. It was one of the funnier and most memorable parts of the movie.
                    - The experimentation with various kinds of constraints is also part of what is known as design thinking, an iterative method taught at Stanford’s D-school for the practical resolution of problems and the creation of better future situations. Since we could need an entire book to do design thinking justice, you’ll find several excellent ones listed in the resources section of this book.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - To achieve true breakthroughs, we must allow our minds to wander. Research shows that alternating between cognitively challenging work and activities with a low cognitive load enhances creativity.
                    - Walking is one of the best activities to enhance creativity. Mason Currey found it was the single common factor among nearly two hundred of the world’s most prolific inventors and innovators. Be disciplined in your process and always have a way to capture your thoughts along the way.
                    - Although walking outside may be ideal, don’t let the absence of the perfect setting hinder you. Walking around the office or even on a treadmill provides tremendous creative advantages.
                    - A change of environment sparks creativity. This change can be to your physical environment, or to your auditory, social, or psychological environments.
                    - Setting constraints can be helpful, whether they are financial constraints, time constraints, or creative constraints. Likewise, removing constraints can also produce unexpected breakthroughs.
            - Chapter 4: The Butterfly Process
                - How Breakthroughs Happen Inside Your Head
                - “CREATIVITY IS JUST connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. . . . That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things.”1
                - What Steve Jobs is describing is called “associative thinking,” and is essential for breakthrough thinking. Too often, we make the mistake of assuming breakthroughs are freestanding ideas, something never thought of before by anyone in any context. The truth is that almost every breakthrough is a combination of ideas that already existed.
                - Henry Ford’s breakthrough of the assembly line came when he made an association between the Chicago meatpacking industry’s use of mechanized hooks and bakeries’ use of industrial conveyer belts.2 He put the two together, applied them to the building of the automobile, and the assembly line was born.
                - A breakthrough in gun accuracy came when gunmakers looked to the bow and arrow. The feathers on the back of arrows cause the arrow to spin, and the spin makes the arrow fly straight. In the same way, a football flies straight when thrown in a spiral. To make their bullets spin, gunmakers carved spirals inside their gun barrels. Accuracy increased fivefold. Because putting feathers on arrows was called rifling, these guns became known as rifles.3
                - René Laennec was a French doctor who one day observed two young children communicating through a long, hollow piece of wood. One scratched the end of the stick with a pin and the other put her ear to the far end of the stick to hear it. The wood amplified the sound. Laennec went home and invented the stethoscope.4
                - For T. J. Parker, what he did when he was bored helped him start a revolution in the medication industry with his company, PillPack.
                - In 2006, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center released a study showing that educating patients, and much more importantly, placing their medications in single-serving blister packs, increased proper use of prescription drugs from 61 percent to 96 percent. But the study noted that blister packing was too time consuming to scale.5
                - This matters because a study of patients with cardiovascular conditions showed that nearly half of all hospital admissions were caused by medications being taken improperly.6 These mistakes cost Americans millions of dollars—by some accounts, billions—every year. If someone could figure out how to scale blister packing medications, millions of people would be healthier and millions of dollars would be saved.
                - Enter Parker.
                - With his cofounder Elliot Cohen, he founded PillPack in 2013.7 PillPack sends people their daily doses of multiple medications in single-serving packs with the date and time of day it is to be taken on the label. How did Parker come up with this?
                - First and foremost, Parker was steeped in the pharmaceutical world. The reason he heard of the Walter Reed study is that his father, a pharmacist, had started a business prepackaging meds for patients in nursing homes.
                - Parker had then gone to pharmacy school, but also taken classes in industrial design, furniture design, architecture, textiles, and clothing design. He told us, “I studied design because I was bored. The things you do to waste time because you’re bored are the things you care about and will get good at.” He also volunteered to help run MIT’s entrepreneurship competition and dabbled in tech.
                - Using his knowledge of pharmacology, operations, technology, and design, Parker created a system that uses robots to sort pills into customized packets. Perhaps some credit for the PillPack idea goes to Parker’s pharmacy degree, but a lot of other people with the same degree failed to come up with such an innovative solution to an industry problem.
                - One of Thomas Edison’s least successful inventions was the electric pen, patented in 1876, to help make copies. People just weren’t that into it. In 1891, a man named Samuel O’Reilly saw the pen and had a breakthrough. What did O’Reilly figure out?8
                - Here’s one way to approach the question. What job could O’Reilly have had that the electric pen would be useful in, but in a different way than Edison intended? When he saw an electric pen place ink on paper, what else could he imagine putting ink on?
                - Here’s another way to approach it. What is the essence of a pen? We think of a pen as something we write with, a way to communicate language on paper. But that is a pen’s most common use. Its essence is that it makes ink marks on surfaces. Do those marks have to be made on paper? Do those marks have to be language? Of course not. What other kinds of marks could an electric pen make? And on what other kinds of surfaces?
                - Sit with that question. See what comes to you. Or start making a list of kinds of marks and surfaces. Even if you guess wrong the guessing itself is great practice.
                - Here’s another hint. Instead of looking at the electric pen, look at Samuel O’Reilly. He worked in downtown New York in the late 1800s. It was a rough-and-tumble place with many unsavory characters, taverns, and oysters sold from carts on the street. The Brooklyn Navy Yard across the river meant there were plenty of sailors walking the streets. Does that help?
                - Samuel O’Reilly was a tattoo artist. After seeing Edison’s electric pen he invented the modern tattooing machine. Instead of ink writing language on paper, he applied ink to skin to create images.
                - Over a hundred years later, design student Pierre Emm had a similar associative breakthrough. The French Ministry of Culture had challenged students to create remixes of images in the public domain. While riding his bike one day, Emm thought to hack a 3-D printer so it would draw tattoos on skin.9
                - In the 1970s, Southern California suffered a drought that caused people to empty their swimming pools. Skateboarders didn’t fixate on the concrete holes in the ground as empty pools. Instead they saw them as proto-skate parks, the kind you see in nearly every city today. In 1963, another skateboarder, Tom Sims, wanted to combine his two favorite sports, skiing and skateboarding. He also wanted to keep practicing skateboarding during the winter months. In his seventh-grade wood shop class he built a “skiboard.” Skateboarding on snow became snowboarding.10
                - Seven Essential Innovation Questions
                    - Here’s a tool to help you create associations. It’s called the seven essential innovation questions, or SEIQ. This tool does an amazing job of occupying your executive with a goal. Our executives love having a goal. When occupied with a goal, our ENs are happy to let our DN geniuses go at full speed.
                    - SEIQ was created at Autodesk, one of the world leaders in 3-D design software, from entertainment to architecture and industrial design. When you walk through the halls of Autodesk, you will encounter some of their 3-D–printed creations, including a dress, jewelry, coral reefs, a fully functional motorcycle, and a full-size jet engine. Autodesk understands creativity.
                    - Their innovation strategist, Bill O’Connor, leads teams through the seven essential innovation questions, which are actually a guide to thinking creatively. The questions point you in fruitful directions. They are helpful even for “creative types” because they help you hit all the different angles.
                    - As always, these questions cannot guarantee an association or breakthrough or a specific outcome. But they are a very helpful framework to set the optimal conditions for breakthroughs to happen. Moving through these questions creates the right space for butterflies to emerge.
                    - O’Connor says that we have all imagined, looked at, moved, used, connected, changed, and made things in our lives—but we haven’t done so systematically or consistently. The seven essential questions are about the power of the checklist. “This isn’t brainstorming,” he told us, “this is brainstreaming.”
                    - You take whatever it is you are trying to break through and place it in the room, so to speak, and then ask the seven questions about it—that is, look at it from seven different angles. Not all of them work for everything. All you need is one of them to work for the breakthrough to happen.
                    - The key words of the seven questions are Look, Use, Move, Interconnect, Alter, Make, Imagine. The acronym is LUMIAMI.
                        1. Look: What aspects of the problem could we look at in a new way, or from a new perspective?
                        2. Use: What facets of the problem could we use in a new way, or for the first time?
                        3. Move: What parts of the problem could we move, changing its position in time or space?
                        4. Interconnect: What could we connect that’s not yet connected, or what could we connect in a different way, if it already is connected?
                        5. Alter: What could we change or alter, in terms of design and performance?
                        6. Make: What could we make that is truly new?
                        7. Imagine: What could we imagine that would create a great experience?
                    - Each of the seven essential questions has its own checklist. They’re mainly geared toward physical, tangible breakthroughs, so we’ve starred (*) the ones that also work for intangible products and innovations. You’ll notice that almost every question forces you to confront your functional fixedness about an object or concept.
                    
1. Look
                        - Higher: Look at something from a 30,000-foot view.
                        - Reverse: Look at something in reverse, from the back, from the other side.
                        - Value: Look at something from the point of view of its value.
                        - Kids: Look at something the way a kid might look at it.
                        - Ignore: Look at something and ignore what you know to be true about it.
                        - Holistic: Look at something from the point of view of the whole thing, from a systems point of view.
                        - When Einstein looked at the universe and said that no matter how fast you are going, light will always move at 186,000 miles per second to you, he ignored what he knew to be true.
                    
2. Use
                        - Leverage: How could you use this to leverage something else?
                        - Foundation: How could you use this to build the foundation for something?
                        - Substitute: How could you use this in place of something else?
                        - Aspect: How could you use an aspect of this in a new way?
                        - Change: How could you use this to change something you’re doing?
                        - Apply: How could you apply this in a new way?
                        - When Samuel O’Reilly turned Edison’s electric pen into a tattoo machine, he saw how to substitute it for what he was using. And when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a series of microwave towers to facilitate an intercontinental network of telecommunications, they were just focused on improving their trains’ efficiency. But this also became the foundation for the telecom company Sprint (Southern Pacific Railroad Internal Network Telecommunications).
                    
3. Move
                        - Import: What new component could you bring in to make a change?
                        - Rearrange: What could you rearrange to make a change?
                        - Replace: What could you swap out and replace to make a change?
                        - Remove: What could you remove to make a change?
                        - Speed: What could you make go faster or slower to make a change?
                        - Frequency: What could you have happen more or less often to make a change?
                        - When Keith Richards first imagined “Satisfaction” that night in Florida, he heard it as a slow, bluesy song. In a Los Angeles studio, the Stones played it faster and it became the iconic song it is.
                    
4. Interconnect
                        - Power: What could you connect to create a more powerful idea?
                        - Combine: What could you combine with to make something new?
                        - Network: What could you network into to make something new?
                        - Transparent: What could you expose to make something new?
                        - Open: What could you open to the world to see something new emerge?
                        - Partnership: What could you partner with to make something new?
                        - The bow was created and combined with the spear. Partnership made the spear more powerful and the bow more useful.
                    
5. Alter
                        - Quality: What could you improve the quality of?
                        - Design: What could you design differently?
                        - Performance: How could you increase the performance ability?
                        - Aesthetics: How could you change the look?
                        - Experiential: How could you change the experience?
                        - Standardize: How could you make it fit with other things?
                        - Orville Wright changed the design of their airplane’s wings to warp, be movable, and that made controlled, powered flight possible.
                    
6. Make
                        - Processes: What new processes could you create?
                        - Meaning: What new meaning could you create/infuse?
                        - Harness: What could be harnessed to make something new?
                        - Instantiate: What can you instantiate into something new?
                        - Functions: What new functions can you create?
                        - Specialize: What could you make more specialized and focused?
                        - When skateboarders took over empty swimming pools, they created a new function for the pools.
                    
7. Imagine
                        - Amplify: How can you imagine amplifying this?
                        - Easier: How can you imagine making this easier to use, buy, sell, assemble?
                        - Negatives: What are the negatives that you could fix?
                        - Go: Imagine anything you can.
                        - Sci-fi: Imagine a sci-fi solution or improvement.
                        - Try: Try using IT in different ways to see what happens.
                        - Google engineers wondered: What if the car drives itself?
                    - These seven essential breakthrough questions are a guide through the creative process. These are questions the naturally creative ask themselves. But, as O’Connor points out, even they often skip over some of these questions and steps. That’s the power of the checklist he referred to. These questions help individuals or teams engage with a challenge in a creative way.
                    - You can import something from another discipline. You can rearrange your concept. You can remove pieces. You can replace pieces. You can make things happen more or less frequently. You can make things happen faster or slower. You can redesign the experience of something, the look of it, the feel of it.
                    - As you move down the questions, they get closer and closer to fully open, no-holds-barred imagination—from simply looking at the thing itself, to connecting it to other things, to altering it, making it into something else, and finally to imagining whatever you can. This progression opens the mind in steps till the last step, imagine, blows the doors off and says “Go!”
                - Pattern Recognition
                    - In the spirit of experimentation rampant during the early 1970s, Indiana University allowed any student to create and teach a fully accredited course if it was supported by an academic department and approved by the dean.
                    - A lifelong comic-book lover, Michael Uslan knew exactly what he wanted to do. He wanted to teach a course on comic books. He garnered the support of the folklore department, and full of enthusiasm, set out to pitch the dean. It was not an easy sell. Within minutes, the dean cut him off. “Stop. I don’t buy any of this. I read every issue of Superman I could get my hands on as a kid, but all comic books are cheap entertainment for children—nothing more, nothing less.”
                    - “And that,” Uslan explained to a fascinated Olivia over lunch, “is when I asked him: ‘Are you familiar with the story of Moses?’” When the dean answered that indeed he was, Uslan asked him to summarize it.
                    - “So he tells me: ‘The Hebrew people were being persecuted and their firstborn were being slain. A Hebrew couple placed their infant son in a little wicker basket and sent it down the river Nile, where he’s discovered by an Egyptian family who raise him as their own son. When he grows up and learns his true heritage, he becomes a hero to his people . . .’”
                    - At this point in the narrative, Uslan interrupted the dean and asked if he would now, as a childhood fan, summarize the story of Superman. “Well, sure,” the dean responded. “Planet Krypton was about to blow up. A scientist and his wife placed their infant son in a little rocket ship and sent him to Earth. There he’s discovered by the Kents, who raise him as their own son . . .” The dean stopped and stared. The course was approved.
                    - Though it may be hard to remember a time when comic-book heroes were not multimillion-dollar cinema franchises, when Michael Uslan bought the movie rights to Batman, superheroes were, in fact, considered as “a kid’s thing, dorky, nerdy, like Dungeons and Dragons niche.” Comic-book-loving Uslan became the producer of all modern Batman films to date—starting with Tim Burton’s 1989 epic—and ushered in the modern era of superhero movies.
                    - With pattern recognition, you associate two concepts: seeing the underlying patterns and noting their similarity. In recognizing the pattern underlying the stories of Moses and Superman, the dean suddenly understood the point that Uslan was making.
                    - As another example, here’s a summary of Disney’s vision of the story of Pocahontas:
                    - In 1607, a ship carrying John Smith arrives in the lush “new world” of North America. The settlers are mining for gold under the supervision of Governor Ratcliffe. John Smith begins exploring the new territory and encounters Pocahontas. Initially she is distrustful of him, but a message from her Grandmother Willow helps her overcome her reservations.
                    - The two begin spending time together, and Pocahontas helps John understand that all life is valuable, and how all nature is a connected circle of life. She also teaches him how to hunt, grow crops, and of her culture. We learn that her father is Chief Powhatan, and that she is set to be married to Kocoum, a great warrior, but a serious man, whom Pocahontas does not desire.
                    - Over time, John and Pocahontas find they have a love for each other. Back at the settlement, the men, who believe the natives are savages, plan to attack the natives for their gold. Kocoum tries to kill John out of jealousy, but he is later killed by the settlers.
                    - As the settlers prepare to attack, John is blamed by the natives and is sentenced to death. Just before they kill him, the settlers arrive. Chief Powhatan is nearly killed, and John sustains injuries from Governor Ratcliffe, who is then brought to justice. Pocahontas risks her life to save John. John and Pocahontas finally have each other, and the two cultures resolve their differences.
                    - And here is how an observant movie fan, Matt Bateman, altered that description just slightly to tell the story of James Cameron’s Avatar.
                    - In 1607 2194, a ship carrying John Smith Jake Scully arrives in the lush “new world” of North America Pandora. The settlers are mining for gold unobtainium under the supervision of Governor Ratcliffe Colonel Quartin. Jake Scully begins exploring the new territory and encounters Pocahontas Neytiri. Initially she is distrustful of him, but a message from her Grandmother Willow the Tree of Souls helps her overcome her reservations.
                    - The two begin spending time together, and Pocahontas Neytiri helps John Jake understand that all life is valuable, and how all nature is a connected circle of life. She also teaches him how to hunt, grow crops tame dragons, and of her culture. We learn that her father is Chief Powhatan Eytucan, and that she is set to be married to Kocoum Tsu’Tey, a great warrior, but a serious man, whom Pocahontas Neyteri does not desire. Over time, John Jake and Pocahontas Neyteri find they have a love for each other.
                    - Back at the settlement, the men, who believe the natives are savages, plan to attack the natives Na’vi for their gold unobtanium. Kocoum Tsu’Tey tries to kill John Jake out of jealousy, but he is later killed by the settlers.
                    - As the settlers prepare to attack, John Jake is blamed by the natives and is sentenced to death. Just before they kill him, the settlers arrive. Chief Powhatan Eytucan is nearly killed, and John Jake sustains injuries from Governor Ratcliffe Colonel Quanitch, who is then brought to justice shot with arrows. Pocahontas Neyteri risks her life to save John Jake. John Jake and Pocahontas Neyteri finally have each other, and the two cultures resolve their differences.
                    - How was the medieval Catholic Church run just like a modern corporation? Think about it. In many ways, the medieval Catholic Church was the world’s first corporation, with the pope as its CEO.11 It had a large sales force and a mission statement—proselytizing—that demanded the expansion into new markets. The product they sold? Salvation.
                    - A transnational entity headquartered in Rome, the Church had franchises in every city, town, and hamlet; from parish churches to Chartres Cathedral. The College of Cardinals acted like a board of directors, archbishops functioned much like a bevy of vice presidents, bishops were the first regional managers, and priests were, of course, salesmen.
                    - And then came the Black Plague. Priests and monks, caring for the sick and dying, died in great numbers, decimating the sales force. The success of any corporation is predicated upon the consumers’ belief in the product. The plague caused millions of people to begin to doubt the Church’s ability to provide salvation. Monasteries and parish churches sat abandoned like empty stadiums. Cemeteries outside church walls became the scene of orgies. The Church’s stock had crashed.
                    - And then came the Reformation, appealing to the Catholic Church’s own clientele. What was the Reformation but a loss of market share? The Catholic Church responded to the sudden competition like a good corporation: they launched the Counter-Reformation, which can be seen as a massive marketing campaign. The Church started building huge cathedrals, filling bridges with statues of saints, and commissioning songs.
                - The Business Case: Million-dollar Patterns
                    - Think of a hotel. Think of what it does, whom it employs, and what makes for high customer satisfaction. Friendly, attentive staff? Attention to detail? Prompt responsiveness no matter what the hour? Easy check-in? Think of what a great hotel CEO would be like. What does he or she do to ensure that guests have a wonderful experience? How does he or she select and train the staff?
                    - Now think of a hospital. What business is it in? What makes for high patient satisfaction? Less time in the admissions waiting room? Friendly staff? Nurses who show up promptly when the call button is pressed?
                    - What do these two businesses have in common? Both have large volumes of people checking in and out every day, for example. Which elements are crucial to the success of both? One could imagine that friendly and attentive staff would be important.
                    - And finally, what if you hired that great hotel CEO for the job of hospital CEO, and asked him to “make it better.” What would he do? How would he change staff training? How would he improve staff selection? Which best practices could he bring in from his hotel experience?
                    - Guess what? This entire scenario actually played out in real life. In 2006, the Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital hired as its new CEO an executive from Ritz-Carlton hotels who had twenty-five years of experience in the luxury hospitality business, but not a single day in the hospital business.12
                    - Gerard van Grinsven focused on the doctor-patient relationship. He had folding metal chairs placed in patient rooms. When doctors came in, they were to open the chairs and sit down beside the bed rather than loom over the patients. It was a simple change that brought the doctors down to the patients’ level and created a more human interaction.
                    - Van Grinsven opened a wellness center and a hair salon and made them available to the public. This made the hospital a place for both the sick and the well, and helped integrate the hospital into the community.
                    - He even created a fast check-in system so that when people were admitted to the hospital it was quick and easy, like checking into a hotel, and their room was ready for them. Essentially, van Grinsven brought the concept of customer service to the hospital industry.
                    - Under his tenure, the Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital became recognized as one of the best hospitals in the country. Someone’s breakthrough council was operating well when they recognized the matching patterns between a hospital and a hotel. That pattern recognition led to a million-dollar breakthrough.
                    - The U.S. Army Special Forces are tasked with complex, often politically delicate missions. Special Forces soldiers are highly intelligent, unusually comfortable with uncertainty, and trained to hold their most primal emotions, like panic, in check. Many of them come through the Army’s University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies, known as Red Team University, under the skeptical if caring gaze of retired Col. Steve Rotkoff, to learn cutting-edge cognitive tools to help them on missions. For the past seven years Judah has been brought in to teach them about the unconscious mental frames that limit their thinking.
                    - During class, the topic of the Arab Spring came up. At this time the uprisings were still taking place. It was an intense conversation. They had almost all lost friends in battle. They were not discussing abstract ideas or names on a map, but real places with smells and hills and dust and people and consequences.
                    - That night Judah was out for beers with three of them. They were still talking about the possible outcomes. It wasn’t idle conversation for this smaller group. One of them had come from a scenario-planning group that was tasked with predicting possible outcomes of the Arab Spring in order to plan future strategy. The other two soldiers were going to deploy to the Middle East shortly. When the next round of beers came, they asked Judah what he thought.
                    - Judah knew better then to offer up some armchair opinion. Instead he helped them to see a pattern through association. He pulled up on his phone the Wikipedia entry for the Revolutions of 1848, which included this information:
                        - The Revolutions of 1848 were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe.
                        - They were democratic in nature, aiming to remove the old power structures.
                        - The revolts first erupted in the cities.
                        - Technological change was revolutionizing the life of the working classes.
                        - Many in the bourgeoisie feared and distanced themselves from the working poor.
                        - The uprisings were led by shaky ad hoc coalitions of reformers, the middle classes, and workers, which did not hold together for long.
                        - Within a year reactionary forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed.
                    - The Special Forces soldiers immediately saw the similarities to the Arab Spring. City-centered revolts against the status quo powers; the technological shift of the Internet and social media; economic inequality; and ad hoc coalitions of the young, the liberal, and the workers. Judah pointed to how the revolutions ended, with the old regimes still in power, only stronger.
                    - In typical understated fashion one of the soldiers said, “Thank you, sir. We’re tracking.” The historical association helped the soldiers create a more effective plan. Rather than arguing about what might happen, they had a breakthrough as to what would most likely happen. And in most places it was exactly what happened, from Iran to Bahrain to Egypt.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - Associative thinking, or making associations between two seemingly unrelated ideas or subjects, is a key attribute of breakthrough thinking.
                    - Use the seven essential innovation questions (SEIQ) to create associations:
                    - How could I look at this differently?
                    - How could I use this in a way it was not intended for?
                    - What if I moved this into a new context?
                    - What if I connected this to something completely new and different?
                    - What if I altered a piece of it?
                    - What if I made something new based on this?
                    - How else could I imagine using this?
                    - Pattern recognition can help you achieve breakthroughs by seeing the underlying patterns between your current situation and one that has already been solved or come to a conclusion.

                - Making Your Head an Attractive Place for Breakthrough Butterflies
                - Your Truly Amazing Brain
                    - Erik Weihenmayer has climbed the “seven summits,” the tallest peaks on all seven continents. He’s stood atop Mount Everest in Nepal and Mount Vinson in Antarctica. As a seven-summit climber, Weihenmayer is a member of a very small fraternity of elite climbers. But that’s not what is most remarkable about his achievement. Not even close. What is truly remarkable is that Weihenmayer is completely blind.1
                    - How did Weinhenmayer make his way through ice and snow? He attached a device to his tongue called the BrainPort. The BrainPort takes in visual information and translates it into electrical impulses, which is exactly what our eyes do. The BrainPort replaced Weinhenmayer’s eyes.2
                    - Of course, the BrainPort has no access to the optic nerve, the road your eyes use to send information to your brain, so its electrical impulses hitch a ride along the tongue’s nerve road into the brain.
                    - As Paul Bach-y-Rita, the cocreator of the BrainPort, said, “We see with the brain, not with the eyes.”3 If you can get visual information into the brain, no matter what the delivery method, you can see.
                    - Even though Weihenmayer’s brain hadn’t been built to interpret visual data coming from the tongue, it was able to rewire itself to do just that. Millions of neurons formed new connections with one another as his brain physically reshaped itself to understand the new input.
                    - We used to think that after childhood, our brains stopped changing or developing. This misconception started falling apart when, with the advent of technology that allowed us to see more deeply inside the brain, we noticed that neural connections could actually change. Neuroscientists saw that parts of the brain grow bigger or smaller based on the kinds of activity people were engaged in.4
                    - In the fall of 2014, a twenty-four-year-old Chinese woman walked into a hospital complaining of dizziness and nausea. It turned out that her brain had no cerebellum, a part of the brain essential for language, movement, and motor control.5 It was, in fact, amazing that this young woman was able to walk at all. The fact that she learned not only to walk, but also to speak, use chopsticks, and master complex Chinese calligraphy, are all testaments to the brain’s amazing capacity to change itself. Other parts of her brain were transformed in order to do the work of the missing cerebellum.
                    - A 2012 study shows that in deaf people the part of the brain used for processing sound gets rewired to process touch and vision.6 And on the other hand, a 2005 study showed that in blind people, the visual cortex is rewired to process sound cues.7 Weihenmayer said it felt like his brain was “rewiring itself.”8 And so it did, because it actually was. This “rewiring” isn’t a metaphor: actual, physical structures inside our brain change.
                    - This ability of the brain to change itself to compensate for deficiencies, to change what parts of itself are used for, is just the start of what we now call neuroplasticity. In fact, our brains remain “plastic,” changeable, our entire lives. Anytime you encounter a new experience or think a new thought, your brain creates a new physical connection among neurons.9 Our experiences, the things we pay attention to, and our behaviors are constant feedback loops changing the structure of our brains.
                        - Your Brain Is Constantly Restructuring Itself.
                        - Physically restructuring itself.
                        - Think about that.
                    - Why is this important for breakthroughs? It’s very simple: breakthroughs are achieved by the creation of something new, and in our brains, this means the creation of new ideas, new thoughts, new understandings. Having a new thought—any kind of new thought—requires the construction of a new connection inside our brain.10 How fast, how easily, and how profusely we can create new connections greatly impacts how many breakthroughs we’ll have. The ability to create new connections inside our brain—that’s neuroplasticity.
                - The Higher Our Level of Neuroplasticity, the Higher Our Chances of Breakthroughs
                    - When we asked Astro Teller, the head of Google’s semisecret research and development facility known as X, how he hires people, he answered, “I hire the most plastic people I can find.”11 This is because Teller knows that having a breakthrough depends upon your ability to physically build a novel set of neural connections.
                    - As babies, our brains are highly plastic because absolutely everything we encounter is new: eating, pooping, language, laughter, crawling, walking. Every single day our brains form new structures to understand what we are encountering: babies perform the equivalent of an Ironman triathlon workout for the brain.
                    - But as we grow up, novelty becomes scarce. Daily routine sets in: same job, same colleagues, same neighborhood, same friends, same TV shows, same politics, and so on. We’ve gone from doing the equivalent of a daily mental Ironman workout to being neural couch potatoes. Our brains have gotten out of shape when it comes to building neural connections. When learning something new feels hard, we decide that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. In reality, it’s not that our brains are no longer capable of change, but that it’s out of practice because we haven’t been working out.12
                    - But thinking that it’s too late, that you should have started when you were young, is akin to sitting on your couch watching TV for a year, failing to do a push-up, and saying, “Well, I guess I’m just weak now. I’d better get used to it. I’m going to double down on this couch-sitting thing.”
                    - You might be tempted at this point to go join one of the increasingly popular “brain gyms” offering computerized pattern-spotting or memory games. Unfortunately, research so far shows that they make you much better at playing these games, but not necessarily at anything else.13
                    - The best way to improve your plasticity is to expose yourself to new things that challenge your brain to build fresh connections. When you keep having the same thought over and over again, and perhaps describe it as being caught in a loop, the physical reality is that you are firing the same path of neurons over and over again. But when you experience or think about something unfamiliar, your brain physically builds a new structure, and it is this ability that enables us to have original thoughts and to create breakthroughs.
                    - Our brains are shaped by the things we pay attention to.14 Any new experience will physically create a new connection. And with your 100 billion neurons, each with the ability to make thousands of connections, there are more potential connections inside your brain than there are stars in the sky.
                - Before We Start: Getting Your Brain Ready for Breakthrough Thinking
                    - We live in an age of distraction. Before the advent of the Internet, there was a limit to the amount of information we could physically get our hands on. Now, we face an infinite avalanche of information every time we go online. Leo Babauta, author of the Zen Habits blog and father of six, told us: “We are increasingly up to our necks in the stream of information, in the crossfire of the battle for our attention, and engaged in a harrying blur of multitasking activity.”15
                    - What’s worse, this battle for our attention is addictive because all our digital communication channels engage our dopamine loops. A common misconception holds that dopamine is related to experiences of pleasure. As increasing numbers of studies show, the famous neurotransmitter is responsible not for pleasure, but rather for motivation, desire, or drive.
                    - With every e-mail, text, Snapchat, or Instagram notification, a dopamine surge drives us to click or open with the anticipation of pleasure. Our electronics have turned us all into gamblers, only instead of pulling the arm of a slot machine or rolling the dice, we check our in-boxes and phones. As Kelly McGonigal explains in her wonderful book The Willpower Instinct, evolution is using the promise of happiness, not happiness itself, to keep us striving and struggling and checking our phones.16
                    - The problem is that breakthrough thinking is driven by this same dopamine drive. Dopamine is what drives us to look for solutions, new approaches, or discoveries. It gives us the curiosity that drives so many breakthroughs. But if we get caught in an online dopamine loop, we are wasting our neurochemical drive.
                    - In essence, dopamine creates the motivation that is needed to create breakthroughs. Don’t waste it on e-mail and social media.
                - Plasticity Exercises
                    - The point of neuroplasticity excercises is not to make you better at the activities themselves. Terry Gross, the famous host of the interview radio show Fresh Air, has taken singing lessons for years. She told her teacher right from the start that her goal was not to become a good singer. “I just want to be inside a song, to the extent that I can be. To just have my body inside a song.”17
                    - In Gross’s case, singing does relate to her line of work, as she’s the voice of a show. But aside from that, music is one of the great powerhouses for increasing plasticity, and for Gross, who has to interview people from all walks of life, finding connections is a great way to come up with interesting questions.
                    - Anything new you learn will promote your brain’s plasticity. But learning something new while doing something physical doesn’t just increase plasticity, it also increases the size of the neural circuit you are creating, which means—you guessed it—more new connections.
                    - In one study on this subject, when high jumpers imagined themselves clearing the bar successfully, they were 35 percent more successful. But when they imagined themselves clearing the bar and moved one of their fingers at the same time, their success went up by 45 percent.18 This is why many of the following tools involve some form of movement.
                    - These tools are not exercises in breakthrough thinking, but rather exercises in plasticity. Stronger muscles will help you when the time comes to compete.
                    - Experiment with movement
                        - Use your nondominant hand for a variety of activities. Brush your teeth, use a fork, use the key to open your house, write your name. This is also a great exercise to experience what it’s like to build new connections—you’ll really feel neuroplasticity at work.
                    - Experiment with taste
                        - Go to a restaurant and order something you’ve never had there before. Really taste it. What’s different about it? Your brain has to create new connections in order to build a structure to represent new flavors.
                        - Make a dish, but leave all the salt out of the recipe. Taste it. Notice how the lack of salt changes the flavor. Now add just a little. And taste. Then add a little bit more. Inch your way forward until you’ve added the perfect amount of salt.
                    - Experiment with sight
                        - Take a new route to work, the market, or home. Notice as many new things as you can. The next day, take the exact same route, but this time try to predict the landmarks you will see.
                        - Watch twenty minutes of a foreign film without subtitles. See what you can piece together about the plot. Are you watching facial expressions more? How well can you understand the emotional state of the characters even without their words? A few of our favorites are:
                            - Life Is Beautiful
                            - Amelie
                            - The House of Flying Daggers
                        - Sit in a coffee shop while pretending to read this book, and watch the people around you. Don’t worry, they’ll be too focused on whatever they’re doing to notice you. Look at their facial expressions. Look at how they hold their bodies. Are they moving fast or slow? Do they seem jumpy, nervous, neurotic? Now pick one person and imagine what his morning has been like. If he’s on a computer, try to imagine what he is typing. Is it for work? Is he searching for a new home? Is he shopping? Writing an old flame? Building a narrative with a who, what, why, when, and how is great plasticity work.
                    - Experiment with sound
                        - Listen to music from another culture, whether Bollywood dance music, African blues, or traditional Afghani music. Lose yourself in completely different tempos. If you are home alone, try to dance. When you try to figure out how to move your body to an unfamiliar rhythm, you force your brain to translate new sounds into movement.
                - Practice Plasticity Like Einstein
                    - Einstein was famous for performing “thought experiments.” He would imagine that certain things were true about the universe and figure out what would happen in a universe like that. These thought experiments promote associative thinking. Here are some you can try.
                        - Gravity: Imagine gravity were to stop working after 10 P.M. Now, what does the world look like? Are our beds on the ceiling? How does this change the sports we play? How do we transport goods? Do people have parties in trees covered by nets? Is there a new business making those nets? Are there lawsuits when the nets fail and people end up floating aimlessly all night? Are movies made where true love is found when these people float down in some random place in the morning? Do teenagers sabotage the nets to float off for adventure?
                        - Social norms: Let’s say that you are allowed to kick someone if they truly annoy you. Now what does the world look like? How do you prove the person truly annoyed you? Are there special courts to determine whether you were truly annoyed? How hard are you allowed to kick someone? Are special shoes made that allow you to kick without leaving a mark? Is there a social peace movement to stop the kicking?
                        - Age: Imagine you just discovered that you are guaranteed to live to be 130 years old and remain in excellent physical health. You might notice an internal reaction, perhaps a fleeting thought of “Wait, I thought I would live till . . .” It’s natural to unconsciously set expectations. Did you know you had been using that age as a general barometer? Now try to imagine what your life would look like. How does that affect the decisions you make? Will you stay in your current career the whole time? Will you remain in your current marriage or relationship? How would society change if everyone were to live to 130? Would everyone be expected to have more than one marriage? How long would people wait to have children? Would everyone have to wait their turn to have children due to overpopulation from longer life spans? Would people auction off their right to have children to others?
                        - Magic: Maybe you’ve heard tales of cities that stand entirely on stilts with suspended walkways for sidewalks. Or a city that consists of nothing but plumbing, pipes, showerheads, bathtubs, and valves connected in a maze of metal devoid of any buildings. Other cities trade only in memories, and you can only buy things by sharing memories. Now you design one of these magical cities. What does it look like? How do the people interact in this city? What are the rules?19 Here’s a way to increase your brain plasticity even more: Imagine you are in the scene, like a character in a highly realistic video game. You’re walking down the street, opening doors, turning your head left and right to look at new things. Imagine putting your hand up to feel the wind. Walk down one of the main streets and hear the traffic.
                    - Now let’s get personal. This exercise is not only great for boosting your plasticity, it’s also a great tool in business and in life. Think of the last meeting you attended. Where was it? What was it about? Who was there? Who spoke? How did you feel throughout the meeting?
                    - Now, using your recently heightened powers of imagination, pull back and watch the meeting as if you were an invisible observer who can see the whole group (including you). What do you see now? Look at the faces of everyone around the table, including your own. Remember, you’re an invisible observer in the back of the room. Was anyone bored? Disgruntled? How was the leader of the meeting?
                    - Ready for the next jump? This one is key. Think of the most junior person at this meeting. (If this was you, pick the most senior.) Don’t just put yourself in her shoes: Get into her skin, see from behind her eyes. How was she feeling? Who was she looking at? What was she concerned about?
                    - If you’d prefer a nonwork situation, imagine a family gathering, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas. How were you feeling? What annoyed you? What made you happy? Now imagine yourself an invisible guest watching the dinner. How is the group experiencing it? Who is looking at whom? Who is eating? Who is serving? Who is bored? Now pick the youngest (or oldest) family member. What was it like for them?
                - Filling Your Garden: Sow More Than You Need
                    - In the early 1890s, everybody wanted the newest technological marvel. Democratic and affordable, the bicycle could cut people’s commute to work in half and enable them to enjoy the countryside on the weekend.
                    - Thousands of bicycle mechanics appeared as if overnight, looking to make bicycles lighter, safer, more comfortable, and easier to produce. They would tinker with ball bearings, rolled steel, differential gears, air-filled tires, and so on.20
                    - Many of these enthusiasts would later use what they had learned in bicycle workshops to create greater transportation breakthroughs. The Wright Brothers, for instance, were both bicycle mechanics.
                    - One of these amateur bicycle mechanics watched as mass production took hold in the realm of personal transportation, and cyclists lobbied for better roads to be built. That man was Henry Ford, and by combining the new concepts of mass production with the new tools invented for bicycles, he gave us the modern automobile industry.
                    - The more raw material you give your brain, the more connections it can make. So when you read an article online, follow the hyperlinks and see where they take you. Filling your garden is an experience in meandering. You may end up far afield, and that’s okay, because you don’t know what might be of interest. You can’t know. This, of course, can be frustrating to those of us who want to know that what we’re doing is generating value, not “wasting time.” Unfortunately, if you want to get to breakthroughs, you need to accept that you’ll never know what ends up being valuable.
                    - When farmers sow seeds, they don’t know which will germinate, which won’t, and how many of those that do germinate will actually bear fruit. It’s nearly impossible to ensure a 100 percent germination rate. So what do they do? They sow more than they need. In military parlance, this is called redundancy. And unlike in management, where redundancy is assumed to be a bad thing, in the world of technology it’s what could save your work (have you ever lost data for lack of a backup?).
                    - “In the technology world of the cloud, we assume the commodity hardware we are building things on will fail, so we have complex failure plans. Data stored in the cloud will often be broken into hundreds of pieces, with three or even six copies of each piece,” explains Microsoft’s Kevin Sauer.
                    - If you want to have more breakthroughs, you need to accept the need for redundancy. Accept that you won’t know which seeds will bear fruit until harvest time. Some may germinate, some may not. Some may germinate, but not bear fruit. You have to be willing to bear that uncertainty. (Chapter 9 will give you the tools to handle it better.)
                    - When we tell you to immerse yourself in your line of work or interest, we don’t mean merely working hard at your job in advertising or sitting down at the piano for two hours a day. Get a clear understanding of the underlying principles, the schools of thought, the ways things have been done or attempted, and succeeded or failed.
                    - It’s important to talk to people doing the same thing as you are. Bell Labs, the famed research center to which we owe the transistor, the calculator, laser technology, UNIX, and many of today’s most essential technologies, was famous for strongly encouraging its newest junior members to knock on the door of Nobel Prize winners and ask questions of “the guy who wrote the book.”21
                    - As for how to approach people and establish the relationships you need, you’ll find information in the resources section of this book, including Olivia’s The Charisma Myth, of course, and Keith Ferrazzi’s Never Eat Alone, the “bible of networking.” Keith, the CEO of a research institute studying human behavior change, illustrates convincingly that relationships are the backbone of all success in business and in life, and shows you step-by-step how to build the relationships you will need. We highly recommend it.
                    - Popular mythology would have you believe that breakthroughs are a solo endeavor. Most often, there are many contributors to major insights. The garden-filling phase is not just about extracting information from other people. You also have to share your latest challenge: give people the context behind the questions you’re asking, the problems you’re working on, what’s making them so difficult, and what you’re hoping to achieve.
                    - Your mindset when sowing seeds must be open and unprejudiced, because you never know who might have an interesting tidbit for you. Remember that early components of breakthroughs don’t look like breakthroughs—they look like miscellaneous pieces of information. Be open and curious.
                    - One trick is to keep certain topics at the forefront of your mind at all times so you’ll be more likely to notice when relevant pieces of information pass by. Another trick is to draw people into talking about something they’re passionate about. Ask them when they first encountered this passion. Did they always love it or did it grow on them? What is it about the activity that speaks to them? You may hear about the history of the thing, the nuances, the best practices. These are excellent ingredients to gather.
                    - You should also read books that are adjacent to your area of interest and talk to people doing something different but related. If you’re a manager in a healthcare company, you might talk to a manager at a retail company or at a hospitality company. If you’re a business manager, learn about how to run a preschool.
                    - If you’re in marketing or sales, it might be helpful to read a book about P. T. Barnum, or about William Randolph Hearst’s role in starting the Spanish-American War. But it could also be just as helpful to read about the publication of Thomas Paine’s pamphlet Common Sense and the American Revolution.
                    - If you’re a manager, it could be helpful to read how the Mongols structured their armies and how they created a sense of connection among soldiers from varied cultures. Or about the practices of traditional cultures, from the Iroquois to Australian Aboriginals.
                    - If you’re a scientist, it could be helpful to read anything in the history of science. But it can also be helpful to read about the history of philosophy as a way to see the different modes of thought that held people in check. You might discover something about the limits of your own thinking. Science fiction has also been known to be a great inspiration for many scientists.
                    - If you’re an entrepreneur, read about the history of Silicon Valley and the entrepreneurs who came before you. You never know what ideas might be sparked by reading about your predecessors.
                    - StartX is Stanford’s incubator for new technology companies. It is made up of young, smart, ambitious people looking to disrupt any and every industry. Many of them have more ideas than they know what to do with. One company was working on wearable technology. During a wandering conversation, the cofounders mentioned to Judah they had another idea for smart fabric. It was not the product they were in StartX to develop; it was a new idea. The problem was that although they knew what their technology could do, they had no knowledge about materials and temperature changes.
                    - Judah introduced them to designers of ski clothing at another client of his, the North Face. People who design clothing for skiing have to think a lot about materials and temperature. Its users are in the cold but are very active, which raises their body temperature. The wearable tech founders and the North Face designers were working in adjacent fields. The wearable tech founders were able to take great strides in their designs by learning from the North Face designers.
                    - We’d love to tell you that they are bringing their smart fabric to market, but they found their technology wasn’t ready. That’s the risk when working with incubators and with breakthroughs in general. Sometimes things don’t work out. That’s not what breakthrough thinking is about. Breakthrough thinking is about learning and trying again. (Part two digs deep into the skills necessary for breakthrough resilience.)
                    - To create (or discover) his theories of relativity, Einstein didn’t just lock himself in a room and think. Instead, he had a group of friends with whom he talked with almost every night.22 They called themselves the Olympia Academy: Michele Besso, Maurice Solovine, Conrad Habicht, and Einstein’s wife, Mileva.
                    - On warm nights, they’d walk the streets of Bern and sit on the riverbank. Other times they’d climb to the top of Mount Gurten, lie on their backs, look up at the stars, and talk until dawn. Then they’d amble back into town and sit at a café, fueling themselves with coffee and ideas.
                    - While the Olympia Academy had very little structure, the members demanded total commitment. When Maurice Solovine skipped a meeting to attend a music recital, Einstein and Habicht went to his house, ate all his food, and smoked a pipe (Einstein) and cigars (Habicht) until the apartment resembled the inside of a chimney. Finally, they piled all his furniture and books on top of his bed. Such was the retribution for giving preference to bourgeois distractions over the Academy.
                    - The group’s members were from fields as diverse as poetry and philosophy, and it was these conversations that helped to break open how he thought so that he could then “break open the universe.” In order to be innovative, Einstein first had to shift the way he actually thought, and that meant ranging far afield from physics.
                    - Literature, art, and music aren’t thought of as “actionable” or “useful” when we’re in problem-solving mode, but are extremely useful to our genius council when we’re on the road to breakthroughs.
                    - If you find yourself in conversation with someone from an adjacent field, here are some good questions to ask:
                        - If you were describing what you do for a living to a six-year-old, what would you say?
                        - Do you have any kind of personal philosophy or guiding principles that help you?
                        - What do you think makes you good at what you do? (They’ll demur but be flattered.)
                        - If I were starting out in your profession, what advice would you give me?
                        - Did you always know you wanted to be an X, or were you interested in something else? (If they always knew, ask why it called to them so strongly. If they wanted to be something else, ask what linked their first interest to their second.)
                    - If you’re concerned about falling down a rabbit hole, try the Oxford Very Short Introduction Series. These are brief books, each about a hundred pages, that offer concise overviews on myriad topics from rivers to Tibetan Buddhism to molecular biology. Choose two or three of these on varied topics and read them. The advantage is that these booklets are limited, physically, in the amount of information they contain.
                    - When you want a fresh insight, you’re guaranteed to be surprised by a different age group, social class, or culture. There’s also the option of drawing solutions from nature, the well-known tactic called biomimicry we mentioned earlier.
                    - The first Japanese bullet train, which could reach speeds of up to 180 miles per hour, had a short, snub nose. At such an incredible speed, the train often built up hurricane-force winds when going through tunnels, shaking nearby houses and even shattering windows.
                    - The engineers tasked with redesigning the nose to create less air buildup found the solution in mimicking the beak of the kingfisher.23
                    - The kingfisher’s beak enables it to dive straight into the water and yet barely make a splash. With its almost Pinocchio-long nose, the new bullet train looks a bit comical. But it no longer causes hurricanes.
                    - It’s key to provide your genius council with a wide variety of examples of how others have done what you’re seeking to do. The more varied, the better: these “others” who have the solution you need could well end up being insects.
                    - In Harare, Zimbabwe, the Eastgate Centre shopping mall and office building uses only 10 percent of the energy that a similar-sized building would use to heat and cool itself.24 It does this by mimicking the design of termite castles, which have the remarkable ability to maintain a steady internal temperature regardless of the outside temperature. Like a termite castle, the Eastgate Centre regulates its temperature by drawing cool air in at the bottom of the building while venting warmer air at the top, thanks to large fans at both ends of the building.
                    - One form of breakthrough is simply recognizing the ready-made solutions waiting to be plucked from the natural world. Waste treatment plants, for instance, used to face the problem of minerals growing on the inside of pipes and slowing down the flow. Traditionally, engineers had to flush the pipes with toxic chemicals to clean them out.
                    - The buildup is calcium carbonate, which happens to be the exact same material from which seashells are made.25 During their growing phase, seashells use a template of proteins that pull in ions from the seawater and hold them in place in a self-assembling crystal. When they reach maturity, the shells exude a protein to stop the crystallization. Today, a commercially made and environmentally friendly substance called TPA mimics this protein that inhibits crystallization.
                    - Throughout this process, consider collecting these ideas in a file. This can be in the notes on your phone, a file on your computer, or an old school notebook. You want to create a central place where you can look through the ideas you’ve gathered in order to focus your breakthrough geniuses and remind them of all the raw material they have to work with. A simple and powerful tool when you’re struggling for a breakthrough is reading through your gathered ideas, and then using one of the breakthrough exercises we will recommend in the following chapter.
                    - The breakthrough experience is both a social, outward-focused experience and a solitary, inward-focused one. Gathering information is external: even if you’re just sitting at your computer reading articles, the information is coming in from the outside.
                    - We encourage you to go out and talk to other people during the garden-filling phase, because when we engage with other people, we connect our associative networks to other associative networks, and that creates a whole new field of possibilities. So we research, we read, we listen, we talk, we argue, we explain, we get pointed to new sources of information, we watch videos, go to lectures, have lunch with different people, all in the service of collecting ideas, facts, and information.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - Brains remain plastic throughout life. We all have the ability to think new thoughts. Although most of us are out of shape neurologically, we can increase our plasticity.
                    - Don’t waste your breakthrough dopamine, your internal drive, on e-mail and phone distraction overload.
                    - Exercise is a magic bullet for raising plasticity and mood. Just five minutes at a time can help.
                    - Plasticity rises when doing, learning, and experiencing new things. Experiment with new movements, new tastes, new sights, new sounds, new stories. Moving while experiencing something new turbocharges the plasticity.
                    - Try Einstein-style thought experiments. Imagine crazy situations or worlds with different laws and see where it takes you.
                    - Gather large amounts of information on a chosen subject or problem so you can immerse yourself in that field of knowledge. Some of what you gather will be useful and actionable. Most of what you gather will not directly lead anywhere, and this is okay.
                    - Look to others. Engaging others will allow you to learn from their perspective and insights. Seek input from people in other fields and professions, even if it may seem they cannot help you.
                    - Look to nature. Mother nature is a 4.5-billion-year research and development project. The practice of biomimicry can teach us a lot.
                    - Remember to keep notes in a central place for later reference. Consider a notebook, or an online app like Evernote, which allows you to sync notes to multiple devices (phone, laptop, desktop) simultaneously.
            - Chapter 6: What’s in Your Net?
                - How to Evaluate the Output of Genius Mode
                - SO YOU’VE GONE through the breakthrough experience, and you’ve come up with one—or many!—ideas that have breakthrough potential. Do you go right out into the world and bet the house on it? No. This is where you bring your executive back to the front office. You may have heard the saying “Write drunk, edit sober.” Now is the time to edit sober.
                - Edward de Bono is one of the world’s foremost experts on how we think. He is a psychologist, a physician, and an author who teaches at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard. One of his most famous tools is called Six Thinking Hats. In this classic tool, a team that wants to brainstorm is given six different-colored hats, each standing for a different frame of mind, a different way of looking at a situation and generating possible solutions.
                - The blue hat focuses on the process, managing time, keeping the big picture in mind.
                - The white hat focuses on facts on the ground, figures, metrics, the reality of the situation.
                - The red hat focuses on the emotional resonance of the situation and the solution, and how others might be impacted, including your empathy and fears.
                - The green hat focuses on creative thinking, new possibilities, new perspectives on the situation and the solution, and on refining new ideas.
                - The black hat has a skeptical outlook and considers risks, potential problems and obstacles of the solution, or weaknesses in the plan.
                - The yellow hat, on the other hand, is an optimistic outlook, positive thinking, a focus on the benefits and best-case scenarios of possible solutions.
                - Using the Six Hats to Evaluate Potential Breakthroughs
                    - We’ve adapted these tools to help you sift through different ideas, to catch which are the potential breakthroughs and which are not.
                    - Though some breakthroughs are immediately recognizable as such, often major breakthroughs come through a series of smaller breakthroughs. We wind our way along the path, eventually coming to the big moment. This evaluation process will help you recognize and capture ideas that don’t burst forth onto the scene but rather appear quietly. It helps you know whether they are signposts on the road to breakthrough, or just gibberish.
                    - Let’s say you’ve had a potential breakthrough about what your team needs to do. You’ve realized you need to encourage more risk-taking while maintaining limits on those risks. Choose which hat you are going to put on, and then look at your ideas from that point of view. You can make your way along in any order.
                    - You might first choose the red hat, the emotional one. You could ask yourself how the team is going to feel about being encouraged to take more risks. Will they be frightened? Feel pressured? Feel liberated? This makes you realize that how they feel will in part depend on how you present the issue.
                    - Then you put on the black hat of the skeptic, the problem seeker, and you see the potential risks—the team going over budget, missing deadlines, building useless models all in the name of taking risks. It could turn into a situation in which people are just doing weird stuff to appear as if they’re taking risks. Then, if you reprimand them, they’d feel confused and betrayed: you encouraged them to take risks and then punished them for doing it. You’d lose trust.
                    - So you put on the white hat and look at the facts on the ground. How much time and budget can you allocate to risk? What areas should not be touched? This will help you create constraints.
                    - You put on the green hat to think creatively about those constraints. What are reasonable limits and guidelines you could give the team ahead of time? You could limit how far anyone could go with a new idea. You could establish a system that all new ideas had to move through in order to slow down the process, with kill points along the way where new, risky ideas get assessed before they can move on.
                    - Then you put on your yellow hat and look at the benefits of each of these new ideas. How might they play out successfully?
                    - You could put your red hat on again, the emotional one, and look at how these new guidelines might be received by your team; then put on the black hat again and see how this might go sideways.
                    - It’s then time to put on the blue hat, the process one, to make sure that you are still on topic and on point.
                    - You can cycle through these different hats, these different perspectives, as many times as is helpful.
                    - The next step is to bring the breakthrough to people who “wear” different hats. So you find a red hat person, someone who is good at seeing how things affect other people, someone with a high emotional quotient (EQ), and you present the situation and your possible solutions to get his red hat feedback.
                    - Then you find a black hat person, someone who is a good critical thinker and skeptic. You run your stuff by her and see what issues she points out. You get black hat feedback.
                    - You continue through the other hats, collecting feedback from different people in very specific, directed ways that help you sift your idea.
                    - To evaluate your breakthroughs, to know which are worth pursuing, which need further iterations, and what’s still lacking, it is absolutely critical for you to get feedback from others.
                    - One of the startups at StartX came up with an app that could track your movements via your smartphone and then construct a narrative of your day, your week, or your month for you. This app was not what the startup founders had gotten accepted into StartX to work on and they weren’t sure if they should move forward with it.
                    - This was a perfect opportunity to use de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats. Judah identified six people in the incubator who were all naturals at one of the thinking hat perspectives. First he brought in the white hat, the one good at the facts on the ground. She helped the team lay out their idea in clear and concise language. Then he brought in a person good at yellow hat thinking, best-case scenarios, and optimism, and the team shared their white hat pitch. The yellow hat person spun out a number of possible ways this app could be world changing. Parents could make a record of their children’s lives before they have memories. Children could watch narratives of their parents when their parents were teenagers. Politicians could be held accountable. Researchers could study troves of data about human behavior.
                    - Then he brought in the green hat person, the creative thinker. This person wondered if the app could be used to track pets’ days, or what would happen if you created a mesh network of narratives so you could see the interweaving experience of a group of friends or an entire junior high class. What could it teach us about our behaviors as a group of people?
                    - At this point the founders were getting very excited. But then Judah brought in the black hat person, the one who was good at being skeptical. The black hat thinker pointed out that the technology wasn’t ready to track that many interweaving stories. And besides, why would anyone pay for this? They’d expect it to be free. And so how would you sell ads on it?
                    - The fun wasn’t over yet. Next came the red hat thinker, the emotional one. The red hat thinker shuddered a bit. He felt it was creepy, like being followed all the time. And if you turned it on and then off and then on again there’d be gaps in your narrative that made it seem like you were hiding something. Very 1984.
                    - But all was not lost. Judah brought in a blue hat thinker, someone who asked the founders what their big picture was, what the essence of the app was. With that question the green hat, the creative thinker, was brought back in. They traded ideas back and forth and realized that they had assumed the app would track individuals in their daily lives. But it could be used for research. Research had come up before but had been forgotten. It could be used for patients, for diagnoses, for any number of targeted applications where the user was willing and happy for the help.
                    - The developers hit a number of bumps in the road along the way. We helped them with their breakthrough resilience. One day they met a fellow entrepreneur working in medical technology. As they spoke they realized that most medical technology was focused on biometrics, heart rate, sweat, and oxygenation. But the ins and outs of your activity, the narrative of your day, and how that might affect your health was blue ocean territory. They merged their companies and are in the midst of a round of getting funding.
                    - Getting feedback is something that Professor Alex “Sandy” Pentland, director of the MIT Science and Human Dynamics labs, and Olivia’s favorite scientist, strongly recommends you do in person. “When things matter,” he told us, “you need ‘rich’ channels: nuanced, interactive channels that allow for serendipity and spontaneity. And [you need] the immediacy of face-to-face interactions, when both people can be talking at once, getting excited and talking over one another. You need to be able to get the feel of an idea.”1
                    - This is why MIT does not have campuses in any other location in the world: they want their people to interact face-to-face. (Yes, it is often pointed out the irony that the “nerdiest university in the world” is the one that insists on physical interaction.)
                    - Pentland, who also helped create and direct the MIT Media Lab, recommends that you seek feedback from one person at a time, not from a group that will blitz you with feedback. “Think of Minsky and all those other ‘lone geniuses,’” he says. “Yes, they’re slightly odd, and curious about everything. And they get superexcited, and tend to talk about whatever the latest thing that excited them was, with everybody. But they talk to people serially. The thing they bring to person A gets modified by A’s feedback, and what they get as a result is what they bring to person B, so they keep testing and validating their concepts, and the concepts build together into a story.”
                    - Pentland is describing mode switching of a different kind. Instead of switching between our EN and our DN, Pentland has us switching between talking to people and retreating back to our heads to ponder.
                    - And this kind of mode switching hints at a paradox at the heart of how we have breakthroughs. On the one hand we need to be alone for the innovation to come to us. Story after story tells of people being alone when they have their moment of insight. An insight tends to be a quiet, internal event. But on the other hand, we need to be immersed in a flow of ideas. We need to hear what other people are thinking and doing. We need to take in lots of different things.
                    - Pentland’s group has performed the most advanced research on idea flow within groups and organizations, and his book is highly recommended to any executive tasked with innovation. (You’ll find them listed in the resources section of this book.) He speaks of bees who pollinate every flower they come across. At every flower, they pick up the best pollen, and bring it to the next one.
                    - A helpful tip to keep in mind: some flowers have a lot more pollen than others. When you are looking to talk to people about your breakthrough idea, talk to a diversity of people. But also look for people with as multifaceted a background as possible. Former Manpower CEO David Arkless is a good example: he’s worked in senior positions inside multinational corporations, he’s worked outside of them as a consultant, he’s worked on getting more investment opportunities inside China, and on teaching marginalized youth in the Middle East and North Africa the skills needed to join the world economy.
                - Have a Crew
                    - Many breakthroughs come from people who have a trusted crew they run their ideas by. As we’ve seen, Einstein had his Olympia Academy. J.R.R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis used to read their drafts of The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia to each other. Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville were good friends and wrote many letters to one another about their work.
                    - It is important to have a crew, a group of people you trust and who understand what it is you are working on. This crew makes you feel safe sharing your thoughts and, ideally, asks you questions that help clarify your ideas or push you forward into new areas.
                    - When Keith Richards first listened to his opening eight bars of “Satisfaction” he was unimpressed. Mick Jagger described it this way: “It sounded like a folk song when we first started working on it and Keith didn’t like it much, he didn’t want it to be a single, he didn’t think it would do very well. I think Keith thought it was a bit basic. I don’t think he really listened to it properly. He was too close to it and just felt it was a silly kind of riff.”2
                    - Richards didn’t see the breakthrough potential of his song. It took his bandmates to help him see it and refine it. Similarly, the first attempt at recording the song didn’t go well. It took a second session to get it right. Your crew can act as a backup net to catch the butterflies that you don’t see or that get away.
                    - Judah was having a conversation with Andreas Ramos, who has been an engineer in Silicon Valley for over twenty years. He was telling a story about a side project his cubiclemate was working on in the mid-1990s. The cubiclemate was talking about his idea and Ramos and a third man started shooting ideas back and forth and decided they’d help write the code for their coworker Craig and his list. Yes, that was the foundation of Craigslist.
                - Biomimic Your Brain
                    - So how do you build your trusted crew? Who should be in it? For starters, anyone who seems to excel at one or two of the Six Thinking Hat styles. But there’s a deeper question. What skills should you gather in the room to increase the chances of a breakthrough?
                    - When viewed from the point of view of design, Nature is a master class, and your brain is a design that has been iterated, tested, adapted, and iterated again for millions of years. If architects can learn how to save energy from termite castles, and engineers can learn about aerodynamics from a kingfisher’s beak, think about what you could accomplish by biomimicking the brain’s breakthrough council.
                    - Mimicking the way your DN works, here are other qualities and personality types to look for in your crew or your team:
                    - QUALITIES:
                    - Empathy: You’re looking for people who are skilled at taking other perspectives and have a natural ability to feel how others might respond to a new idea. You want the people others go to when they’re having a hard time.
                    - Contextual associations: You want people who have worked in different industries, people who have dual majors in subjects like math and poetry, or French and economics. You need people who have a deep hobby in something apart from their job, like computer programmers who practice Tai Chi or executives who paint.
                    - Memory: Historians could be good for this, or people interested in history. People who worked on previously successful breakthroughs in a similar space are helpful, as is anyone who has been there before and is reflective about his experience.
                    - PERSONALITY TYPES:
                    - Mavens: You want someone on your crew who has her finger on the pulse of the market, the company, the culture. You want someone who knows what is expected to happen in five years and is already up on the thing that will be huge in six months. This person can gauge your breakthrough and give thoughts about whether or not it is new enough, different enough, and is pointing in the same direction as the cultural arrow.
                    - Makers: You want the mechanical engineers, the designers, the builders, the people who will draw and build mock-ups and get very concrete about an idea. You need to stay grounded in reality and in what is feasible.
                    - Theorists: You need people who have a deep knowledge of the subject even if they’ve never tried building something but have only studied it. Theorists can often offer deep pattern recognition and new insights that those only concerned with applying their idea might miss. This means including people who might be a little older.
                    - Generalists: These people have a wide range of knowledge and as such they are very good at acquiring new information. They learn new things and integrate them and connect them to other things. They can be very helpful just listening to topics they don’t know about. Their lack of knowledge leaves them open to helpful connections and insights.
                    - There are two more steps you can take to biomimic the brain’s breakthrough process with your teams. The first is the addition of a catalyst.
                    - When you’re off-task, not only does the power reroute to your genius lounge, but your hippocampus, your memory-maker, starts to build memories out of all the new things you’ve learned. Your hippocampus has an odd quirk: as it forms the new memories it takes pieces of them, shards of information, and tosses them into your genius lounge. This is why it is important to keep gathering new information. These new bits of information act as catalysts for your genius lounge.
                    - So it can be a good idea to add a catalyst to your genius council crew.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Catalysts for Your Genius Lounge
                        - Adding a new and/or random person
                        - Moving to or working in a new location
                        - Setting a ridiculous goal for an hour, like collecting all the orange Post-it pads in the office
                        - Reading a page or two from a book
                        - Watching a scene from a movie, or the whole movie
                        - Sharing specific stories (your worst vacation, your best day of school)
                        - Researching the history of anything—a building, a movement, a country, cave art
                    - The other thing you can do to biomimic the brain’s system is deputize someone, probably the leader already, but deputize them still to play the role of the EN. Here’s what that entails:
                    - You nominate the person.
                    - Everyone agrees.
                    - The EN announces the problem, focusing the team, even if everyone knows what the issue is.
                    - The EN steps back and lets the team begin.
                    - The EN steps in to point out a particularly intriguing idea or suggest a direction, then steps back again.
                    - This dance continues. The deputized EN acts as a guide for the genius council and makes sure you don’t go down too many rabbit holes.
                - Critique Your Breakthrough
                    - Tom Chi is a legendary innovator in Silicon Valley. This is how he runs a brainstorming session. We found his set of rules ideally suited for testing out your breakthrough with your trusted crew. It also is structured enough to allow you to invite others into the process.
                        - 1、Start by having everyone state the things that work about the breakthrough. Write those on a board. Pick a goal, say fifteen things that work.
                        - 2、Don’t write them in a list. Write them all over the board. No list, no prioritizing, no top, and no bottom.
                        - 3、Draw a picture beside the idea. Pictures turn on a different part of the brain, the nonverbal part.
                        - As Chi told us, “You are taking something that is usually linear or sequential and verbal and making it something nonlinear, parallel and visual.”3
                        - This next part is important.
                        - 4、Tell everyone to do their best not to judge anything. Try to stay open minded. Do not voice opinions. Try not to let your ego become attached to any of the ideas on the board.
                        - Chi suggests you spend thirty minutes to reach your goal of fifteen things that are working. And then you need to create a transitional moment.
                        - 5、Take two minutes of silence. Tell everyone to look at the board, take it all in, and let things start to connect.
                        - The silence and the looking at the board are a way to use the EN to direct the DN’s genius lounge to start connecting things, and to give it space to do so. You are creating a ritual to slide everyone into their associative state.
                        - 6、Have people draw the connections they see among the things that are working. Have them up at the board drawing lines. You want people to see the connections. Use different colored markers for the different connections. (The board starts to look like a spider web. That’s okay. It will slow down naturally.)
                        - 7、Ask people to tell little stories about the connections they see, saying how these things are connected. The stories encourage people to build on one another.
                        - 8、Clusters will begin to emerge, groups of connected ideas. Once you have six, eight, ten clusters, ask people how they feel about them. Ask them to rate the clusters on a scale of 1 to 10.
                        - 9、Only look at clusters that rank at 7 or above.
                    - This process allows you and your trusted crew to go through your breakthrough and see all the possibilities in it, or see that it just doesn’t work. Or see that parts of it work but parts are missing or need more thought.
                - Build a Constraint Box
                    - Thomas Edison did not invent the lightbulb. The first patent for a lightbulb was taken out in England in 1841. But Edison did create the first commercially viable lightbulb forty years later. And he didn’t do it alone. Francis Robbins Upton was a Princeton graduate who was suggested to Edison by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz. The self-taught Edison was suspicious of university types but he hired Upton and set him to work on the lightbulb.
                    - In order to find the right material to be a filament Upton built a constraint box. One constraint was that the filament have a high resistance. This meant it wouldn’t take a lot of energy. The second constraint was that the filament glowed at a low heat. This meant it would be useful at a low energy point. The third constraint was that it give off enough light. The fourth constraint was that the filament last long enough to make the lightbulb economically sensible.
                    - Once he had built the constraint box, Upton and his team made an exhaustive list of all the materials that met these criteria. They then tried each one until they reached carbonized bamboo, a filament that lasted for 1,200 hours.
                    - While Upton used his constraint box to find his breakthrough, they can also be helpful to evaluate the output of your genius mode. Judah gave this tool to a team of researchers at Genentech. They were complaining about how difficult it is to work with federal regulations, so Judah had them lay out all the regulations they had to deal with. He used the regulations to build a constraint box. They formed the walls of the box.
                    - The constraint box clearly defined the space the researchers could work in. It also focused their energy, so that they accepted the regulations rather than banged their heads against them, and used them to define the scope of their work.
                    - Then Judah asked the researchers to share all their assumptions and he wrote them all down. Then he called them out one at a time and asked the whole group, “Is this true?” Doing it out loud as a group led to a number of assumptions being challenged and then taken away. The energy in the room increased as the team started to feel more confident.
                    - Although drug research is a long and complex path, the team is still using the constraint box and assumption challenge today.
                    - It can help to make this whole process visual by drawing it.
                        - Think of all the constraints that stand between you and the breakthrough you seek. Let’s say there are eight constraints.
                        - Draw a big cube. Make sure it has a big, empty center.
                        - Draw eight squares around the edge of the cube.
                        - Write one of the constraints inside each of the squares.
                    - You now have a constraint box and that big, empty center is your solution space. It is important to make the center big and empty so that you see it as a space of opportunity rather than confinement.
                    - You can do one of two things with the box. You can take your breakthrough and see if it fits inside the constraints, or you can use it to set the conditions and then go and let your mind wander.
                    - Now, outside of that box, on the edges of the paper, start to write down all your assumptions. Write everything you assume about your constraints and about the breakthrough you need. By writing them down, you see them and get to ask yourself if your assumptions are true. You get to test and push on them. If one of them is wrong and you get to remove a constraint, you suddenly have an opening in your constraint box. That opening is a space for a breakthrough to sneak in.
                    - But more important, the constraint box sets the stage for your DN to create a breakthrough. It sets parameters around your problem and then, by laying out the assumptions, offers places for your DN to test out possible breakthroughs.
                - Try It
                    - In order to see if it is a breakthrough, try it, play it out. Too often we sit with our breakthroughs and do not put them out into the world to field-test them. Go ahead. Test them. Do them. Take action. That’s why there’s mode switching. The breakthrough is not a breakthrough if you’ve just thought of it in your DN. You have to do something with it, put it into the world with your EN. If you’ve caught a butterfly, you need to make sure it can fly.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - Once you’ve finished your research, gathered your data, and discovered new ideas, it’s time to evaluate.
                    - Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats is a good tool for this analysis. We highly recommend his book Six Thinking Hats.
                    - Feedback from others about your ideas is critical. They will provide you with new insights, as well as identify your potential blind spots.
                    - Build a crew. Surround yourself with other people who can assist you. They will give you feedback, supplement your knowledge, make critical connections for you, and even help you execute your breakthroughs.
                    - Biomimic your brain by mapping your team members to the brain regions that create breakthroughs. Remember to add a catalyst and deputize someone to play the role of the EN.
                    - Use Tom Chi’s critique method of brainstorming in a more open way. Get as many ideas up on the board as you can, find the connections, invite quiet, create narratives, create clusters of ideas and rank them.
                    - Create a constraint box by writing out all your constraints in the form of a box. The big, open center of the box will define your breakthrough space.
                    - Put your idea into the world and see what happens.

        - Part Two: The Blockers
            - Chapter 7: The Spiders of Fear
                - A Powerful Butterfly Repellent
                - HAVE YOU EVER felt a rush when imagining vivid negative scenarios? Let’s say you’re walking down the street and you feel your phone buzz in your pocket. You pull it out and see you have a text from your boss or colleague saying: Please stop by my desk when you get back from lunch. We need to clean up your presentation for next week. You feel a wave of dread start in your gut and move through your whole body. You grow cold and hot at the same time.
                - Oh my god, you think, I totally screwed up the presentation. I knew I hadn’t gotten it right. As you walk to the office, you look back over the past week to find all the signs that you had indeed failed. There was that look your coworker Josh gave you at lunch. And that comment Amy made about needing to burn the midnight oil. That was directed at you, you now realize, because the presentation was missing the mark. Now you’ve gotten yourself to a place where not only is your presentation no good, but everyone else knows it.
                - I’m going to be fired. It’s going to be impossible to find another job in this city. I’m going to have to move, take the kids out of school. Sell the house in a down market and lose my shirt.
                - This train of negative fantasies is called catastrophizing: interpreting mundane events as major threats. The fear it creates is one of the greatest inhibitors of our breakthrough butterflies.
                - Part of why we catastrophize is to emotionally prepare ourselves for the worst. You weren’t being crazy; all the above scenarios could have happened—it’s not as if you were worried about aliens coming to Earth. Everything you described has indeed happened to other people and could happen to you. But there was no foundation for them: all the things you imagined after reading the text message were pure conjecture, directed toward catastrophe not from real evidence, but rather from your emotional reaction.
                - This reaction may have served you in the past to prepare you for terrible things. And there is a part of you that enjoys catastrophizing: there’s a rush of adrenaline and other neurochemicals as the fight-or-flight response kicks in. And paradoxically, catastrophizing can make you feel safer: At least I won’t be caught off-guard. At least I can prepare.
                - We have a deep-rooted instinct to envision the worst because this tendency has, in the past, kept us alive. Mother Nature “wants” us to catastrophize because although a happy outlook might have led to a happier life, it also likely led to a much shorter one. The nervous system, which ensures our survival, was developed from jellyfish onward to figure out, essentially, “Can I eat this, or is it going to eat me?”
                - Now, if you miss out on eating something that’s not a big deal; there will be other things to eat. However, if you miss the signal that this is something that will eat you, well, that’s a problem of existential proportions. Those human beings who did not panic at the sound of a twig snapping? They weren’t our ancestors—they were dinner. And so we evolved to have a bias toward negative information, a strange attraction to catastrophizing, in a manner similar to our predilection for fat and sugar.
                - But just like fat or sugar, while catastrophizing may once have been useful, now it just serves to shut down our brain.1 Worse yet, because of neuroplasticity, the more you use those negative mental pathways, the deeper the groove gets, thus the easier it becomes to fall into it in the future. Welcome to the negativity bias: the tendency to give far more attention to negative details than positive ones.
                - In addition to the negativity bias, we also have a confirmation bias, which is our tendency to selectively retain information that confirms our preexisting notions. Unfortunately, with a negative bias in place, we tend to reconfirm our negative expectations.
                - Negative things produce more neural activity than equally intense positive things. We are quicker to recognize the negative in our world. We recognize angry faces more quickly and easily than happy faces. We even learn faster from pain than pleasure.
                - The amygdala, the fire alarm of your brain, uses two thirds of its neurons to look for the negative. These negative things get stored into memory almost immediately, a library of things to watch out for. Positive things need to be held in awareness for twelve seconds to transfer to longer-term memory. (This is why gratitude, meditation, and loving-kindness are necessary: we need to focus on the good for our brain to be able to truly remember it.) As Rick Hanson puts it, your “brain is like Velcro for negative experiences but Teflon for positive ones.”2
                - From our survival instinct’s perspective, failure can lead directly to death: misjudge the speed of the saber-toothed tiger and you die. Miss the crack of a branch announcing a falling tree and you die.
                - Failure can also indirectly lead to death via loss of status: there’s a reason we have the expression “the lion’s share of the meat.” The lower on the totem pole, the fewer resources the individual receives, and someone who falls so low he or she is outcast from the tribe would certainly die. Both our own instincts and conventional wisdom seem to give us these two messages:
                    - Failure is bad. If you’re failing, you’re doing something wrong. If you do something wrong, you should be punished. Punishment is shameful, so you must avoid failure at all costs. Failure is shameful, and if you fail, you are a loser and the group will shun you.
                    - Failure is avoidable. If you’re failing, you’re doing something wrong. You should be able to avoid failure by doing everything right.
                - What we’ll see in the following chapters is that both the fear of failure and the experience of failure are unavoidable. So you need to get good at handling them, especially because they can block the breakthrough process. This chapter covers fear of failure; the next chapter will teach you how to handle the actual experience of failure itself.
                - The goal of this chapter is to understand why we have this fear of failure—where it comes from—and what to do about it. You’ll see how the fear of failure affects both our minds and our bodies. You’ll learn about the most common manifestations of the fear of failure: the impostor syndrome, the inner critic, and the perfectionist. And you’ll learn how to handle them so they no longer block your breakthroughs.
                - It’s Unavoidable
                    - Fear is an unavoidable part of the breakthrough process, whether you’re seeking an intentional breakthrough or experiencing an unintentional breakthrough. The only difference is when fear shows up, and what this fear is directed toward.
                    - For intentional breakthroughs, it shows up before the breakthrough. You want the breakthrough because you think the consequences will be good. So you don’t fear the consequences of implementation as much (though things certainly could go wrong in the implementation phase). What you fear are the consequences of the quest itself. What if you fail to achieve the breakthrough you are seeking? What if it turns out you’ve wasted time, money, and effort “for nothing”?
                    - The thing is, we have to accept the possibility of failure and deal with that fear. Intentional breakthroughs such as business or science innovation breakthroughs require the willingness to fail, to accept that what you’re trying to achieve may not work out. If you’re not willing to fail, you’ll only do things guaranteed to succeed. Guaranteed success can only occur with things that have been done before, and therefore, by definition, aren’t innovative. If you’re not willing to risk failure, you won’t innovate.
                    - Most successful innovation breakthroughs were the result of countless iterations—which means countless consecutive failures. Or as Adam Berman, executive director of the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business Institute for Business Innovation puts it: “Innovation is evolutionary rather than revolutionary.”3
                    - For intentional breakthroughs, the fear you experience is the fear of not reaching that breakthrough. This fear of failure can prevent you from attempting all the things you’ll need to do to succeed.
                    - For unintentional breakthroughs, the fear comes after the breakthrough, but is just as toxic as it is for intentional breakthroughs. Unintentional breakthroughs aren’t always welcome, and are often good in the long term but highly unpleasant in the short term—such as the sudden realization that “Oh! I need a divorce.”
                    - The unintentional breakthrough may seem to come out of the blue. It’s actually, as we’ve seen, the result of a lengthy process, just not a conscious one. In this case, there was no need for you to deliberately “attempt” anything or “try things out” as you must for an intentional breakthrough. So you won’t experience the fear of not getting to the breakthrough. You might be experimenting on your way to the breakthrough, but you won’t be aware you’re doing so.
                    - We may worry: “What if this breakthrough turns out to be wrong? What if I rely on it and then end up looking like an idiot? Even if it’s right, what will be the consequences of following it? Or what if I have the breakthrough and it’s a legitimate breakthrough but I’m so broken I can’t change? If I try to have a personal breakthrough and I fail, does that mean that I am stuck like this forever?” And so forth.
                    - Whereas intentional breakthroughs raise the fear of not attaining a breakthrough, unintentional breakthroughs raise the fear of implementing a breakthrough.
                    - Whether before or after a breakthrough, you will encounter fear: it’s an integral part of the path. So you might as well learn how to overcome it, because otherwise, it could paralyze you. For intentional breakthroughs, fear could prevent you from attempting a breakthrough, thus preventing you from achieving one. For unintentional breakthroughs, it could prevent you from implementing your breakthrough, thus rendering it useless.
                - It’s a Real Breakthrough Blocker
                    - Have you ever cried during a sad movie? Consciously, you know it’s just a movie. You realize those are actors who are delighted to pretend they’re dying heroically in exchange for a nice paycheck. Yet your brain sees what is happening on the screen and your tear ducts start flooding whether you like it or not. There’s a reason they’re called “tearjerkers.”
                    - In fact, you don’t even need a movie screen to experience this effect: you can do it yourself. Close your eyes. (Well, close them after reading this.)
                    - Imagine standing on a beach where the sand is too hot for comfort.
                    - Imagine digging your feet down to the cooler sand beneath. Feel the relief.
                    - Imagine being handed a margarita, taking the slice of lemon off the top, and biting into it. Feel the sour taste on your tongue. Do you feel your taste buds salivating in response?
                    - Now imagine you’re in a classroom. Imagine you’re at the chalkboard, dragging your fingernails across it.
                    - Sorry we made you cringe. There was no chalkboard, there was no lemon, and unless you’re reading this on a beach, there was no sand either. And yet your mind produced very real physical reactions in response to completely imaginary events.
                    - So what happens when you’re feeling anxious about an upcoming performance review? You’re focusing on everything you think could go wrong—and all of a sudden, your palms get sweaty and your pulse starts racing. Why? You’re not in the performance review, after all! But because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality very well, when you imagine something, it will often send real, physical commands, as if the situation were real.4
                    - When you imagine failing, these imaginary scenarios have the capacity to generate a real neural response, the activation of the threat response.5 Even if the failure hasn’t actually happened, the simple fear of failure can generate the fight-or-flight response.
                    - The effects of this automatic response are well known. When a zebra is chased by a lion, stress hormones cause its body to increase heart rate and oxygenation, and shunt resources away from momentarily superfluous functions such as digestion, which is why a zebra chased by a lion immediately “lightens his load” while running away.6
                    - In the same way, when stressed, the human body shoots stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol through our veins and directs all its resources toward crucial fighting or fleeing functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, acuity of vision and hearing, and so forth.
                    - As Dr. Esther Sternberg, author of several books on the physiology of stress, explains, “The physiological stress response is actually designed to be an asset. It speeds the heart rate and diverts blood away from the gut and to the muscles so we can run away. It constricts the pupils of our eyes so we can focus on our attacker. It dilates the bronchi of the lungs to increase blood oxygenation, and converts energy stored in the liver into fuel for strength and stamina.”7 It’s designed to help us survive.
                    - Your body stops worrying about living ten more years, and instead reacts to survive ten more minutes. “Nonurgent” functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system shut down for you, just as they do for the zebra. And your “superfluous” functions—such as cognitive reasoning—also shut down. In other words, because it’s not critical to survival, rational thinking gets shut down when the fight-or-flight response is activated.*
                    - The physiological stress response was designed for short bursts. It evolved to put us in a powerful state in which most of our resources are narrowly focused on survival for a very short time. We were never supposed to stay in such a heightened state for very long.
                    - If a zebra chased by a big cat on the African savannah manages to escape, it eventually slows down, stops, sits down, and then starts to shake intensely. We might interpret this as fear. In fact, the shaking helps the zebra release itself from the hold of its stress hormones, because it instinctively knows it is safe. When the zebra stands up again, it has returned to its earlier relaxed physiological state, with no residual stress in its body.
                    - The reason the fight-or-flight system is so powerful is because it is built with direct neuron-to-neuron contact. This means that the neurons communicate electrically with one another, skipping the slower process of neurochemicals crossing the synaptic gap. Basically, your rational functions send instructions via horse-drawn carriage while your fight-or-flight system uses FedEx.
                    - Negativity exists to make you act, to either fix the problem or get out of the situation. We evolved feelings like fear or anxiety partially to get us to do something.
                    - There are times when the discomfort of intense fear is highly appropriate. If you’re in life-threatening danger, then you want your body pooling all of its resources to ensure your immediate survival. However, in the civilized, modern world, few situations call for a full fight-or-flight response. In other cases, our instinctive reactions actually work against us.
                - How Fear Affects Your Mind
                    - Think about a time you’ve become paralyzed in the middle of an exam, or even worse, on stage. You’re like a deer in the headlights, frozen, heart racing, palms sweaty. You’re trying to remember what you’re supposed to do, but your mind is blank. Your higher cognitive functions have ceased operations.
                    - Heightened stress triggers the mind to declare a state of emergency. In response your mind turns off what it deems to be unnecessary functions. Unfortunately, that means the body is reducing our cognitive abilities just when we may need them most. It’s hard to remember this in the midst of an anxiety attack, but rest assured that this reaction is an entirely normal one intended for your well-being.
                    - Philippe Goldin, director of Stanford’s Clinically Applied Affective Neuroscience lab, told us: “The threat response can hijack attention; making us revert to very simplistic mental algorithms and habitual, automatic solutions.”8 David Rock, founder of the NeuroLeadership Institute, explains: “The threat response impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving.”9
                    - The kinds of fear we are talking about here manifest as social inhibition in the form of the impostor syndrome and the inner critic, and as perfectionism and its close cousin, maximizing.
                    - Social inhibition is, essentially, the fear of “what others would think.” This fear of looking stupid or being judged are the flip side of our social awareness. Social inhibition is absolutely useful; it’s the part of us that makes us “civilized,” but it has its drawbacks. Insights can only happen in the wake of quieting your frontal lobes, and that is where your inhibitions live.
                    - The problem with these inhibitions is that they can lead us to repress thoughts and ideas that could lead to great breakthroughs. In some cases, diminished social inhibition caused by the degeneration of the prefrontal lobes led people to a fountain of creativity—painting, art, and so forth. People who’d never had an artistic bone in their body suddenly became prolific artists.10
                    - Social inhibition is likely the single biggest blocker you will encounter on your road to achieving or implementing breakthroughs. Does this mean you should voluntarily damage your frontal lobes? Of course not. You might have heard of the case of Phineas Gage, whose frontal lobes were damaged by a railroad accident in 1848. In the aftermath of the accident, he became “fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity (which was not previously his custom).”11 The man was “gross, profane, coarse, and vulgar, to such a degree that his society was intolerable.”12 We need our frontal lobes to function in society.
                    - But it’s certainly true that finding ways to put the frontal lobes “to sleep” is an age-old search for creatives. The saying “Write drunk, edit sober” captures it perfectly, and embodies the whole process of breakthrough thinking.
                    - Write drunk: Drinking quiets the frontal lobes, the social-inhibition part of our brain, the monitor. You quiet the EN and you let the DN run wild to generate a burst of breakthrough thinking.
                    - Edit sober: Then you bring the EN back online to sift, evaluate, and prioritize. This is the phase of convergent thinking, critical thinking.
                    - Social inhibition shows up in our brains in the prefrontal cortex, and in our minds as the impostor syndrome and the inner critic.
                - The Impostor Syndrome
                    - The impostor syndrome is experienced when successful and competent people believe they don’t know as much as they should and live in constant fear of being exposed as a fraud. It is that deep certainty that most of us feel at some time in our life, that we are just not good enough.
                    - Since the impostor syndrome was first identified, research has indicated that more than 70 percent of the population has had this feeling at one time or another.13
                    - The impostor syndrome is also an obstacle to breakthrough thinking. If you believe that you don’t really know what you are doing and spend mental energy fearing others will find you out, how can you possibly believe you will see something no one else has seen before? Can you imagine Thomas Edison thinking to himself, I’m no inventor, or Steve Jobs plagued by thoughts like, Who am I to design computers?
                    - And yet, counterintuitive as it may seem, the impostor syndrome is most prevalent among high performers. When we speak about it at Harvard, Yale, Stanford, or MIT, the room goes so silent that one could hear a pin drop. When students discover this feeling has a name, and they aren’t alone in experiencing it, we see them exhale in relief. Michael Uslan still gets that feeling occasionally when he’s in the studio. “I still have this background feeling that one of the security guards might come in and throw me out,” he told us.
                    - The impostor syndrome can be a great motivating tool, getting us to work harder than anyone else. But at what cost? First, part of your brain is always occupied with it—arguing with it, trying to push it back, hiding away from it. Second, if there are not “enough” successes according to whatever arbitrary measure your brain has decided on, it activates the sympathetic nervous system and deactivates your creative capacities. Third, worst of all, it can prevent you from taking the risks you need to take to reach breakthrough innovation.
                    - Today we finally have effective tools to handle the impostor syndrome. But just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power. By reading this section, you’ve already taken the first step.
                    - The basis of the impostor syndrome is having the impression of yourself as not competent for this job, this activity, this position—in our case, as not capable of creating breakthroughs.
                    - This image, this impression of yourself, is technically known as a self-image. A self-image, in plain terms, is who we think we are: our personality, our capabilities, etc.14
                    - Once people have developed an image of themselves, there is a strong tendency for that image to be maintained by a bias in what they pay attention to, what they remember, and what they are prepared to accept as true about themselves. In other words, the self-image becomes self-perpetuating.
                    - The most effective way to handle (or even dismantle) the impostor syndrome is to change your self-image.
                    - Before going any further, here are two shortcuts you can try to change the playing field so that the impostor syndrome simply no longer applies.
                    - Shortcut [1](1.md): Change the Label
                    - Try simply changing the name of what you aspire to be, and see if there is another term that fits more easily with your current self-image. Olivia, for example, doesn’t consider herself to be creative. Resourceful, yes. Ingenious, yes. Those words feel comfortable. But she’s not comfortable calling herself “creative,” because creativity is not in her self-image. To her, “creative” belongs to those other people who have a design sensibility, to artists, to people who do creative things (like music, art, and theater). Creativity feels intangible, elusive, something she can’t see the contours of. But with the self-image of someone who is “ingenious and resourceful,” she achieves the same creativity.
                    - Shortcut [2](2.md): Flip the Scenario
                    - Ask yourself which elements of your experience (or lack thereof), personality, or background does the impostor syndrome use to make you feel like a fraud. Take each of these in turn, and flip them around:
                    - “I’m too young for this job” becomes “My youth is a huge advantage because . . .” Do you have a better grasp of new technology? A better understanding of the customer base? A greater willingness to take risks, to try new things?
                    - “I’ve never worked in this industry before. I’m not an industry expert” becomes “The fact that I’m not an industry expert is a huge advantage because they already have industry experts falling from the rafters. They don’t need one more. What I can bring is a wealth of new perspectives and different experiences, and I can bring everything I’ve learned outside this industry to bear on the problems we’re facing here.” And so forth . . .
                    - “At Microsoft,” explains Kevin Sauer, “the imposter syndrome has taken on a life of its own. One of our most famous technologists wrote a blog about being a phony and it is referenced all the time internally.15 It is almost so ‘hip’ to be a phony that it isn’t.”
                    - Three of the brain’s limitations will come in handy to change a self-image that’s holding you back. The brain doesn’t have a great sense of:
                        - Scale: A series of little things can be just as difficult to handle as one big thing. Our brain isn’t naturally adept at prioritizing, and for once you can make it work in your favor. This is the science of “small wins.” Dr. Teresa Amabile, professor and director of research at Harvard Business School, to whom we owe so many discoveries in the field of individual and team creativity and productivity, organizational innovation, and the psychology of everyday work life, found that even small wins could have a tremendous impact on people’s inner state. “Many of the progress events our research participants reported represented only minor steps forward. Yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions.”16
                        - Time: A vivid event that happened thirty years ago can feel “as if it were yesterday.” It’s the vividness and ease of recall that matter here, rather than how recently the event occurred.
                        - The difference between imagination and reality, as we’ve mentioned earlier.17
                    - Now we will show you how you can use each of these limitations in your favor, to change your self-image step-by-step.
                        - Step 1: Define Your Goal
                        - What new self-image do you want? Meditation teacher Tara Brach, author of the wonderful Radical Acceptance, asks, “Who would you be if you didn’t believe you were fundamentally flawed?”18 What self-image do you need to achieve your goal? Maybe you want to see yourself as a risk-taker. Perhaps you’d like to see yourself as creative.
                        - Step 2: Gather Past Evidence
                        - Look back into your past and find at least five acts of creativity, five ways you’ve been creative. These could be big acts of creativity (that time when I found a solution for the whole project) or small ones (I found a way to get around the traffic jam this morning). It’s quantity rather than quality that matters here. Remember you can also try replacing “creative” with “resourceful” or “ingenious.”
                        - Step 3: Put the Evidence on Display
                        - Ellen Langer of Harvard University and her colleagues enlisted the help of two groups of elderly men in 1981.19 The men, who were in their seventies and eighties, were sequestered far away from the world in a monastery in New Hampshire. When each group arrived at the monastery they encountered a world with the clock turned back. They were surrounded by things from the 1950s, a black-and-white television, an old-time radio, even copies of the Saturday Evening Post. They listened to a radio broadcast of the 1959 Preakness Stakes. They watched the 1959 movie Anatomy of a Murder. They even talked about the political issues of that era, such as the space race or Nikita Khrushchev.
                        - Both groups stayed for one week, though not at the same time. There was only one difference between the two groups of men. The first group were told to pretend they were once again young men. The second group were told to simply reminisce about being young men.
                        - Prior to and following the experiment, both groups of men underwent extensive cognitive and physical tests. After one week in the monastery both groups showed improvement in strength, hearing, vision, posture, and even flexibility, their fingers more agile and less curled by arthritis. They scored better on intelligence tests too. But the group of men who actually pretended they were young men showed significantly more improvement than the group that only reminisced. Their bodies actually seemed younger.
                        - “Wherever you put the mind, the body will follow,” Langer concluded. By the end of the monastery study Langer was playing touch football with these men. The canes they had used to walk now lay at the side of the field. “It is not primarily our physical selves that limit us,” she explains, “but rather our mindset about our physical limits.”
                        - In order for this technique to be effective, you need to truly surround yourself with the evidence of a new self-image. In addition to these lists of past creative acts, you can also post photos around the room of you doing creative or crazy stuff—anything that shows you being socially disinhibited!
                        - Step 4: Embrace Your New Self-Image
                        - Though many of us assume that our behaviors flow from our beliefs and attitudes, in social psychology it is understood that most often our behaviors are what change and form our attitudes, not vice versa. This cognitive dissonance theory suggests that our behaviors have a stronger influence on our attitudes than our attitudes on our behaviors.
                        - “The way that people change their self-image is to act,” Robert Cialdini, preeminent psychologist and author of the landmark book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, told us.20 “One strategy is to undertake a systematic program of action that fits with the self-image they aspire to.”
                        - If you start behaving in creative ways, even if the new behaviors don’t feel natural at first, your attitudes and beliefs will follow in order to reduce your internal cognitive dissonance (“Gee, I must be creative after all”). This is a more effective way to change our self-image than self–pep talk (“I am creative, and can do something creative”).
                - The Science of Small Wins
                    - Remember, research has shown that small wins have enormous power, and as Charles Duhigg describes it, “an influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves.”21 Small wins fuel transformative changes by convincing people that bigger achievements are within their reach. And what that means for you is to start with small steps, steps so small they seem ludicrously easy. That helps you build success momentum.
                    - Duhigg added, “‘Small wins are a steady application of a small advantage,’ one Cornell professor wrote in 1984. ‘Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win.’ Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.”
                    - B. J. Fogg, founder of the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, told us, “For about six months, I’ve been obsessed with ‘success momentum,’ the feeling you get when you succeed over and over. When you manage to change small things in your life, you feel a growing sense of satisfaction and control.”22
                    - It seems our brains aren’t very good at distinguishing big successes from small successes. Your successes don’t need to be big things, like cleaning your entire home. Just wiping out the bathroom sink, he explained, can help create success momentum if—and this is key—you feel you succeeded.
                    - As Fogg explained, small successes are easier to get than big ones, so you can stack up many small successes within a few minutes. And you can have dozens during any given morning. Small successes (not big ones) are the fastest, simplest way to build success momentum.
                    - When Fogg knows he’s going to have a hard day, he told us that he “does a series of small wins to build momentum, increase confidence and resiliency.” He especially favors tidying the house. It’s also useful to combat procrastination: when B. J. finds himself procrastinating, he gives himself a window during which he can do “small win” activities.
                    - Here’s how small wins can help create a new self-image: If you have lost touch with your inner creative genius, start with tiny creative acts, such as making up nicknames for your plants or daily objects—Philip the photocopier, for instance. Then start to invent a backstory for each of them. Philip is from Minnesota, loves football (Go Blue!), and so on. Accumulating a lot of small wins can bulk up to a big win and a new self-image.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Changing Your Self-image
                        - Define your goal. What self-image do you want?
                        - Gather past evidence. Look into the past and write out five ways you’ve been creative.
                        - Put the evidence on display. Pin them up on the wall or use a Post-it. Do this every night for ten days. On the last evening, read all the items at once. See how you feel about your self-image now.
                        - Embrace your new self-image. Take advantage of the science of small wins and build up many “small successes.”
                - The Inner Critic
                    - The inner critic is that nasty voice inside your head telling you that you have done this and that wrong, or that you are a failure, or any other of the infinite varieties on this theme our inner critics come up with. It is especially dangerous since it is most apt to launch the sympathetic nervous system, and so prevent us from even attempting anything.
                    - A good way to know whether the inner critic is operating within you is to pay attention to how often you hear the word “should” in your own mind. You should have left earlier, or perhaps, You should be exercising daily. The inner critic causes you to, as they say, “should all over yourself.”
                    - Since internal attacks are perceived by our mind in ways very similar to those a real, physical attack would be perceived, they can generate the automatic physical reaction we met in the previous section, the threat or fight-or-flight response.
                    - Professional basketball and football players often trash-talk to cause an opposing player to doubt his own abilities. Michael Jordan was famous for this. Unfortunately many of us trash-talk ourselves. We self-criticize, doubt our own abilities, and turn on our threat response. This can have a negative effect on our ability to perform.
                    - As Dr. Philippe Goldin put it, “When people call in sick, their lack of productivity is obvious. But a more insidious hindrance to productivity happens when people are consumed by negative thoughts throughout the day. Internal self-criticism can severely limit innovation and creativity.”23 Though people may be physically present, they’re really locked in a duel with their inner critic, unable to move forward. And because that mental absenteeism isn’t visible, it can go unaddressed.
                    - Self-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field. We have come to consider self-criticism and self-doubt the “silent killers” of business. So many executives suffer from it, yet so few dare speak out about it.
                    - Over the years, we have heard everyone from junior associates to the most senior executives confess that much of their workday is spent in battle with negativity, an army of inner critics pointing out disappointments, forecasting failure, beating the drum of despair. In some cases, they (and we) were amazed they accomplished anything at all. One executive told us a full 80 percent of his day was spent fighting his inner critic.
                    - 
                - The Inner Critic and Body Language
                    - This kind of negativity doesn’t just affect our actual performance, it also affects how others perceive us.
                    - Let’s say you’re in a conversation. You say something, then immediately think, Oh, that was a stupid thing to say. What’s going to happen to your face? You may wince at the thought and your expression may tense. Because we can’t control our body language, any negativity in our mind will eventually manifest on our face.
                    - No matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they’ll assume that expression was a reaction to them—what they said or did, or what you think about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language and your performance.
                    - People know their self-doubt and self-criticism doesn’t help them, yet they can’t let it go. Recognizing and acknowledging its purpose (“My body is responding because it’s trying to keep me safe”) or finding self-compassion (“Of course I’m reacting this way—this is scary”) can help break the cycle.
                    - Here’s how the inner critic can hinder your breakthroughs. Let’s say you’re considering trying a new way of running meetings.
                    - Your brain, with its ingrained negative bias, starts to imagine the possible failures. Immediately, you imagine others’ reactions to your failure. Feelings of shame and fear rise up. You want to shut down, run away, hide, and certainly not try this experiment in real life.
                    - But what actually happened here? The experience is in fact our own internal discomfort created by our inner critic’s verdict on others’ judgment. The good news is that everything we’ve just described happens entirely inside our heads. Let’s see how to change this internal experience.
                    - Knowing how to handle the inner critic is essential to unleashing your breakthrough potential. Unfortunately, our first reflex when under attack is to try to argue with the inner critic. And this is where practices like cognitive behavioral therapy, excellent in getting us to detach from thoughts and get some perspective, can get us into trouble.
                    - Trying to suppress the thought would make things worse. But you can learn to dance with your shadow; you can learn to handle your inner critic. With practice, by using techniques such as the ones you’ll learn here, you can achieve some distance from internal negativity, and maybe even get to a place where the inner critic’s voice evokes in you only a smile or a chuckle. We promise.
                - Find Your “Everybody”
                    - Dr. Martha Beck, who says that she has become extremely intimate with her inner critic through three Harvard degrees (including a PhD in sociology), explains that “everybody’s Everybody is composed of just a few key people. Our social nature makes us long to fit in with a larger group, but it’s difficult to hold the tastes and opinions of more than five or six individuals in your mind. So the resourceful social self creates a kind of shorthand: it picks up a few people’s attitudes, emblazons them on your brain, and extrapolates this image until it covers the entire known universe. The vague compilation of folks you call Everybody is what psychologists term ‘the generalized other.’”24
                    - The tool that Beck recommends to detach from this limiting “everybody” in your mind is the most effective we’ve seen. Here’s how it works: find all the statements about creativity, innovation, and breakthroughs that you would like to believe about yourself and that could objectively be considered true.
                    - For instance:
                        - I have an amazingly capable brain. We guarantee that you do. Your brain processes millions of bits of information every second, without your even thinking about it.
                        - I’m highly creative by nature. Look around the room at the lists you’ve put up on the walls. Think of the adventures you created for your daily objects.
                    
. . . and so forth.
                    - For each of these statements, make two columns:
                        - {{[table](table.md)}}
                            - 
                                - People who have told you that this (or something like it) is true
                                    - People who have told you this (or something like it) is not true
                            - I have an amazingly capable brain.
                                - Mary, Jeff
                                    - Sam, Fernando
                            - I am highly creative.
                                - My first-grade teacher (Yes, this counts.)
                            
. . . and so forth.
                    - Fill in as many blanks as you can, and it’s perfectly all right if the same name comes up several times. The important thing is that you are not allowed to generalize; you must use specific people.
                    - Look over the columns of names you’ve written down, and answer the following questions:
                        1. Whom do you like more? (People on the left or people on the right?)
                        2. Whom do you respect more? (People on the left or people on the right?)
                        3. Which people have the happier, more fulfilling lives? (People on the left or people on the right?)
                        4. Which people have more stable, intimate relationships? (People on the left or people on the right?)
                        5. If you had a baby and were forced to leave your child to be raised by other people, whom would you choose? (People on the left or people on right?)
                        6. Which individuals most deserve to have their opinions ignored, belittled, and discounted? (People on the left or people on the right?)
                        7. Why in the name of all that’s holy would you give any credence to the people on the right?
                - Create a New “Everybody”
                    - Because of our innate deference to authority, that encouraging, positive “everybody” is most powerful when composed of people you admire.25 You could pick people who were tremendously successful after a long string of failures, like Lincoln, or people who enjoyed tremendous success while failing two times out of three, like Babe Ruth.26 You could, for example, put up a photo of Babe Ruth on the wall with a caption that reads:
                    - Failed 6 times out of 10.
                    - Greatest player of all time.
                    - Cheesy? Perhaps. Effective? Absolutely.
                    - In fact, famous athletes are a great source of imperfection examples: Michael Jordan had a 50 percent failure rate for free throws; and Pelé and Diego Maradona, two of the greatest soccer players of all time, when playing in World Cup games, had a failure rate of 95 percent! That’s right, 95 percent of the shots they took did not result in a goal.
                    - If you prefer non-sports examples, Tom Hanks has been known to say that of the hundred-plus movies he’s made, “seven or eight were good, a dozen more are decent, and the rest are godawful.”27 And this is one of Hollywood’s most successful actors.
                    - If you prefer business authority figures, here’s legendary inventor James Dyson on using failure to drive success:28 “I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That’s how I came up with a solution.” Dyson spent fifteen years creating 5,126 versions that failed before he made one that worked. The payoff was a multibillion-dollar company and a personal net worth estimated at $1.6 billion.
                    - Steven is a very successful entrepreneur. He sold his first company when he was twenty-two years old and his second when he was thirty-two. Both of them had revolved around data storage. Deciding to embark on his third start-up, Steven decided to reach a little further than he had before. He had always enjoyed drawing and wanted to meld his love of art with his love of technology. He had seen a demonstration once where a man wearing sensors on his fingers was able to draw on a specialized screen. The cool part was the man was standing ten feet away from the screen. Steven was hooked.
                    - But he had recently run into two roadblocks. The technology was proving difficult to master and, more important, investors were not impressed with the potential. They just didn’t think people would pay for it. Steven had had such an easy time with his two previous companies. Their financial upside was clear. They made products with a clear use for businesses. He didn’t have to do much selling. But now he was faced with serious doubts about his product. And what was worse, he really believed in this one with all his heart. He loved this product. He wanted to use it himself.
                    - Clearly Steven needed help with his pitch, but before he could get near that part he needed to regain his emotional momentum. He was feeling like he had failed and it took the wind from his sails. He was beginning to lose hope.
                    - Judah asked Steven to meet him in Emeryville, California, on the east side of San Francisco Bay. He and Steven began to walk. As they did, Judah told him a story and timed their walk very carefully in his mind. He talked about a young animator working at Disney in the early 1980s. The young man had seen the movie Tron and became very excited about the potential of computer animation in movies. He made a short animated film using a computer and showed it to his boss at Disney. His boss asked how much it cost. The young man was eager to tell him that it cost no more than traditional animation. His boss said he wasn’t interested. The only reason to use a computer was if it was cheaper. But the young man wouldn’t take no for an answer. So you know what his boss did? He fired him. The young man was John Lasseter, cofounder of Pixar Animation Studios.
                    - And as Judah finished the story he turned the corner and at the end of the block was the brick-and-iron gateway to the Pixar Studios campus. There was no need to give a pep talk or to say never give up. Steven was bouncing with excitement, realizing he was following in excellent footsteps.
                - The Perfectionist
                    - Perfectionism can show up as a background feeling that you’re never doing enough, that you’re so far behind on everything, or that you’re not on top of everything like you “should” be. The perfectionist makes you focus on all you haven’t done, on all the ways you fall short, rather than all the ways in which you are doing well.
                    - You think of all those books you “should” read, all these exercises you “should” do, and so forth. It’s a litany of “shoulds”—just like the inner critic, the perfectionist causes you to “should all over yourself.” However, unlike the inner critic, the perfectionist tends to focus on the goals and activities in which it thinks you’re falling short, rather than on your value as a human being. It focuses on what you’re doing rather than who you are.
                    - Perfectionism can be related to social inhibition, or it can be separate. Some people seek perfection not because of what others would say, but for its own sake. Some artists are perfectionists just for art’s sake.
                    - There are elements of control and hubris in perfectionism: no one will ever read all the books. No one will ever know all the information. And even if someone could know all the information, they couldn’t know what it all means and how it all connects. Like it or not, we are limited in our capacity.
                    - As shame researcher Brené Brown explains in The Gifts of Imperfection, perfectionism is addictive because when, as we go through life, we invariably do experience shame or judgment for some reason or other, we believe it’s because we weren’t perfect enough. And rather than questioning the faulty logic of perfectionism, we try even harder. Essentially, the self-blame lets us keep the aspiration of being perfect.
                    - Perfectionistic thinking assumes that there is a perfect goal to be reached. Perfectionism is marching toward that predetermined goal, with only one acceptable outcome. That march does not allow the downtime that the default network needs, nor does it allow the open-mindedness to see all the new things on the periphery that will lead to a breakthrough.
                    - Breakthrough thinking is recognizing that we’re actually on a journey, engaged in a process. You may end up creating or stumbling upon something you didn’t set out to. Keep reminding yourself that the journey is not a straight line; very often you end up at a different goal than you started toward, and that doesn’t mean it’s a failure.
                    - Here are a few tools to handle your inner perfectionist. Though each one might not vanquish the perfectionist on its own, they’ll definitely give you some breathing space, and when all done together are quite powerful.
                        - Remember that if it’s rare, it’s precious. Philatelists love “flawed” stamps. In fact, most of the most valuable stamps in the world are flawed. The Swedish Three Skilling Banco, Yellow Color Error, 1855 (it was supposed to be blue green) most recently sold for $2.3 million. The Post Office Mauritius, 1847 (“post office” was printed on the stamp instead of “post paid”) went for $3.8 million. It’s the flaw that makes them unique, thus valuable, to the tune of several million dollars. Whenever the perfectionist rears its ugly head, try reminding yourself that whatever action you have taken, whatever “mistake” was made, it is completely and forever unique. There will never again be this sequence of events. This may help to give you a different perspective on imperfections, because our brain’s automatic reaction is to assume that anything that’s rare is precious, and therefore to be treasured.29
                        - Post photos of people you admire with an imperfection-encouraging sentence below, a quote you make up. Yes, the first time you type it and read it, it may feel ridiculous. But within about a week, it will start to feel real. For example, try having an authority figure encouraging you to “only reach 70 percent of perfect. No more.”30 
                        - If you’ve figured out whom you got the perfection mandate from, write a letter, from them to you, about the downsides of perfectionism. This letter should also contain their apology for telling you to be perfect and their encouragement for you to be imperfect from now on. Definitely put up his or her photo surrounded with quotes you create to this effect.
                    - In the next chapter, you will get a failure blueprint, directions on “how to fail right.” Your inner perfectionist will be reassured that it is following a blueprint perfectly—it just so happened the blueprint calls for failure.
                - The Maximizer
                    - Closely tied to perfectionism, the maximizer gives you the desire, the drive, and sometimes even the compulsion to make “the best” decision. It’s less about making a perfect decision, in the absolute, Platonic-ideal sense, and more about making the best possible decision, in a relative sense, in comparison to others. It’s about getting the most out of a situation.31
                    - In a sense, perfectionism is more idealistic because it is measured against an internal standard of perfection, whereas maximizing is measured against an external standard: Will someone make a better choice than I will? Was there a better choice available? Will a better choice eventually come along?
                    - The maximizer is rarely caused by social inhibition, but rather by our own internal drive to get the best from the situation. In this sense, it is more closely correlated with greed.
                    - Though it is less personally destructive than the inner critic or the impostor syndrome, the maximizer can still greatly hinder your ability to achieve breakthroughs. Yes, this focus on maximizing does lead you to make marginally better choices. And within a certain range, it is a good tool for success. But it can easily go overboard, and you can find yourself spending an hour on the exact wording for your e-mail or social media post or on choosing the best brand of laundry detergent.
                    - Worse yet, leading authority Barry Schwartz has found through years of research that the maximizer also leads you to:32
                        - be less satisfied with your decision
                        - get less happiness out of that decision and its outcome
                        - be less happy in life in general
                    - How do you put the maximizer on a leash? Schwartz has several suggestions, such as setting a predetermined, arbitrary limit to the amount of maximizing you allow yourself—limiting the amount of research you do to choose a product, or the amount of time you spend figuring out the best route, and so forth.
                    - Unfortunately, arbitrary limits don’t work very well for strong maximizers. For those people, an arbitrary limit feels morally wrong, almost sacrilegious. If this feels like you, what you can try instead is to deputize your maximization.
                    - For example, you could make an agreement with yourself that for any product you’re considering buying, if you can find a review in a consumer report Web site, you’ll go with their recommendation. These organizations specialize precisely on the comparison and evaluation needed to make the best possible choice (the essence of maximizing). The tests they put things through are intense, extensive, and comprehensive, and deciding that you want to keep reading further reviews (especially from amateurs if you’re just surfing the Web) is just plain irrational. Make an agreement that you will accept the amount of research and comparison the consumer reports Web sites have done as good enough.
                    - One of our clients deputized her health choices regarding to any new health information that comes out to a few of her friends who she describes as “health nuts.” “They are willing to spend hours poring over science articles, cross-referencing studies, and keeping up with the latest research with a passion and commitment that I could never match. So I’m quite happy to simply ask them for their conclusions and recommendations and go with that!”
                - Handling Fear: Quick Fixes
                    - So now you know what happens when the sympathetic nervous system is activated, and what a threat that is to breakthrough creativity. You’ve learned a variety of tools to help prevent its activation. But what can you do once it is activated?
                    - To calm the sympathetic nervous system, you need to activate its counterpart, the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system, as psychologist Rick Hanson explains, is more fundamental to life than the sympathetic nervous system (the fight-or-flight response).
                    - If your sympathetic system were surgically disconnected—as it was in years past as a last-resort treatment for hypertension—you would remain alive and pretty much yourself, though unable to cope well with commuter traffic, root for the home team, or have an orgasm. But if your PNS were disconnected, you would quickly die.
                    - Fortunately, we have several tools with which to access and activate the parasympathetic nervous system. The mind can turn stress on, but it can also turn it off. Here are some quick fixes if you’re feeling that you are in a less than creative state:
                        - Check your breathing. When we’re feeling stressed, anxious, or in another active-SNS state, our breathing is usually rapid and shallow. Use the body’s effect on the mind by taking deep, slow breaths. As you now know, your actions influence your beliefs; if you breathe as if you were calm, you’ll feel much calmer.
                        - Change your body’s position. As Stanford’s Deborah Gruenfeld found, people who assume expansive poses (taking up more space) experience a measurable physiological shift. In one experiment, assertiveness- and energy-promoting hormones rose by 19 percent, while anxiety hormones fell by 25 percent. Assuming a strong, confident physical posture will make you genuinely feel more confident and more powerful. As you feel more powerful, your body language will adapt accordingly. This in turn gives you yet another biochemical boost, and the cycle builds upon itself.33 All you have to do is get the cycle going, and if you keep practicing, confident body language will become second nature.
                        - Imagine getting a great hug from someone you love for twenty seconds. Of course, you may not have twenty seconds, but when you do, this is remarkably effective.
                        - Name your feelings. Try simply naming the feelings you’re experiencing—anxiety, fear, shame, whatever they might be, don’t worry about getting the “right” or “best” label—and adding “and it’s okay” or even “and it’s welcome.” For instance, “I’m feeling fear, and it’s okay.”
                        - Yawn. Yes, really! Yawning activates the parasympathetic nervous system and relaxes our body. This is why you’ll often see athletes yawn before a competition.
                - Relaxation
                    - Harvard professor of medicine Dr. Herbert Benson is truly the pioneer for Western medicine on how to activate the parasympathetic nervous system at will, through a procedure now known as the Relaxation Response.34
                    - In one of his recent studies, he showed that the mind can control genetic activity through the Relaxation Response. Three groups of meditators were studied: novices, short-term meditators (fewer than ten years), and long-term meditators (ten years or more). In this cross-sectional study, blood samples from all participants were analyzed to determine the expression of more than twenty-two thousand genes on measures of inflammation and cell lifespan.35
                    - The Relaxation Response (RR) was observed to turn genes on or off, to amplify or decrease their effect. Eight weeks of RR on novices produced the same results (affecting the same genes in the same way) but to a lesser degree. The probability of this occurring by chance was one in ten billion.
                    - Furthermore, the RR increased the effect of cognitive restructuring: when the mind is quieter, it is more receptive to new facts coming in. The protocol described next is therefore an excellent preamble to any visualization or mental rehearsal exercise.
                    - Putting It into Practice: The Relaxation Response
                    - Step 1: Pick a focus word, phrase, image, or use your breath as an object of focus.
                    - Step 2: Find a quiet place and sit calmly in a comfortable position.
                    - Step 3: Close your eyes.
                    - Step 4: Progressively relax all your muscles.
                    - Step 5: Breathe slowly and naturally. As you exhale, repeat or picture silently your focus word or phrase, or simply focus on your breathing rhythm.
                    - Step 6: Assume a passive attitude. When other thoughts appear, simply think Oh well, and return to your focus.
                    - Step 7: Continue with this exercise for an average of twelve to fifteen minutes.
                    - Step 8: Practice this technique at least once daily.
                    - Oxytocin is another surefire way to quiet the sympathetic nervous system and activate the calming parasympathetic nervous system. Paul Zak, author of The Moral Molecule and expert on the topic of oxytocin, was one of our key science advisers for this book. Among other things, his research showed that certain activities reliably cause people’s brains to release oxytocin. He gave us a list of his favorites.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Paul Zak’s Favorite Oxytocin Triggers
                        - Give someone a hug. Aim for eight hugs a day!
                        - Try compassion meditation. (We’ll cover this next section.)
                        - Dance.
                        - Soak in a hot tub.
                        - Surprise someone with a gift.
                        - Pet a dog.
                        - Take a hike with a friend.
                        - Write a note of thanks to a teacher or mentor.
                    - Thanks to neuroplasticity, all of the oxytocin-releasing techniques in this exercise not only make you feel good in the moment, they also build your oxcytocin-producing brain muscles. And although “oxytocin is a purely social molecule, i.e., it requires a positive social stimulus for release,” as Zak told us, this social stimulus need not be real: the right imagined social stimulus would produce some of the same effects.
                - Gratitude
                    - Gratitude can be both a state of mind and a feeling, and there are practices and processes that can help you reach a state of mind or a state of heart, a feeling, of gratitude. Some of us think our way into gratitude; some of us feel our way into gratitude.
                    - Why is gratitude good for the breakthrough experience? Because it releases oxytocin. A lot of difficult feelings will come up on the road to breakthrough. Gratitude, and the oxytocin it releases, is a really good remedy for most of them. Oxytocin will wash away stress chemicals in your brain.
                    - Research is clear that gratitude helps us live longer, be healthier,36 and even happier.37 By helping us think of things we already have—whether material items, experiences, or cherished relationships—gratitude acts as an antidote to negative feelings. Not only is it good for health and happiness, it’s also good for your social connections, friendships, and family relationships. It will even increase your level of charisma. Truly.38
                    - Gratitude is a really important tool. But few of us can easily get into a space of gratitude for long periods of time. Human beings are instinctively wired for hedonic adaptation: we tend to take our blessings for granted.39
                    - And even with good intentions, there’s a catch-22: telling yourself that you “should” be grateful is often counterproductive, as it only makes you feel guilty. If someone tells you “you should be grateful,” it’s far more likely to bring up resentment than gratitude.
                    - Just like resolving to read all the books on your nightstand by the end of the month, or trying to read War and Peace in one go, it can be daunting to try to be grateful for your whole life all at once. Instead, just as you would start with one chapter, or the shortest book, pick a small part of your life and be grateful for that.
                    - Pick something, right now, anything that you could be grateful for: your ability to see, a nice piece of art on the wall, or a fantastic sunset. If gratitude feels cheesy, you can use the word “fortunate.” “I am fortunate because I can walk.” It doesn’t have to be something profound; small positive things can have a significant impact on our brain.
                    - This is one of the few cases where comparison can really help, if you use it right. If you’re having trouble accessing gratitude, try comparing your situation with others who are less fortunate. But don’t make the mistake of choosing an extreme example right off the bat.
                    - We know someone who unfortunately has the reflex of comparing his situation with the worst possible one he can possibly imagine: the victims of the Darfur genocide. This creates an immediate sense of guilt that he “should” be going around in a constant state of gratitude, 24/7, because his situation is so much better.
                    - This kind of comparison doesn’t help. Yes, it is absolutely important to stay aware of what’s happening in the world, and to do everything we can to stop the horrors that are unfolding. But when you’re just starting out learning to feel gratitude, that gap can be too huge and backfire or be counterproductive.
                    - Instead, start close to home. We evolved in small tribes, and in many respects that’s how our brains still operate. You know how they say “a man feels rich when he earns more than his neighbor or brother-in-law”? Same concept.
                    - Scan your body from head to toe and find a few things to be grateful for. Could be as simple as your ability to see, hear, or breathe. You think I’m kidding? There are many people for whom every single breath is a struggle.
                    - Think of one small luxury you have that many others around you do not. Do you have keys in your pocket, or anywhere near you, right now? Listen to George Hill’s extraordinary, well-told memories of being homeless for twelve years.40 “Now, every time it rains and I have keys in my pocket, I have a joy of life that you cannot believe.” It is so very, very easy to fall through the cracks of the system. The loss of a job, an accident or illness leading to hospital bills you cannot repay—and before you know it, you too are “one of them.”
                    - Perhaps the healthiest object of comparison to elicit gratitude in you is your former self. In addition to getting you to focus on your blessings, this gives you a sense of progression, of upward movement, that in itself is a wonderfully solidifying feeling.
                    - Think back to high school. For the 2 percent of you who enjoyed high school, this exercise will not work. But it will be of interest for the other 98 percent of us. Remember some of your difficult moments: Perhaps the sense of doom you felt as you came to class totally unprepared for the calculus, chemistry, or history test. Perhaps the general feeling of awkwardness that is the all-encompassing experience of being fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen years old. Perhaps the deep surety that this uncool, misunderstood hell was going to be your life forever.
                    - How different is your life today? How much better is your life? Be thankful for your independence, for owning your own car, for not living with your parents, for your good friends, for a spouse who loves you. Take a moment and feel gratitude for these changes, changes in your environment, and changes in yourself.
                    - Looking back to how we were in the past to see how much we’ve grown gives us perspective on all the good things currently in our lives—the perspective we need to truly feel gratitude for what we have.
                    - You could have a running list of accomplishments on a sticky note on your computer to help you realize how far you’ve come. Every month, or even every week, choose one accomplishment to bask in. It costs you nothing, and it rewires your brain in very advantageous ways.
                    - For most of his childhood, David did not have a lot of friends. “I remember delivering to my parents the list they had requested of friends to invite to my Bar Mitzvah. There were three names on the list. It was a very lonely way to go through life.”
                    - By his own accord, the reason David didn’t have many friends is that he wasn’t always the most emotionally or socially attuned person. “That’s putting it very kindly,” he corrected. “Some would say I was just completely oblivious to other people’s feelings.”
                    - Nowadays, David still doesn’t host many parties, and when he does, they’re for a very small group. But it’s not because he doesn’t have any friends. Quite the opposite: he has too many friends, and as an introvert inviting them all to one party would be exhausting.
                    - When David has to decide between two or three things he’s been invited to do over a weekend, he thinks back to his lonelier years and feels gratitude for his current social life.
                    - Have you ever noticed how most of us tend to focus on the things in our life that are going wrong—all the messes we see from the inside—yet we tend to compare this with all the things that seem to be going right in others’ lives—as seen from the outside? That’s not a fair comparison: we’re comparing our insides with someone else’s outside.
                    - But we can make this work to our advantage by viewing our life through a third-party lens. Of all the gratitude tools, this is one of our favorites. To complete this exercise, you will need to sit down with a few minutes to spare. It is best to have a pen and some paper available. Writing accesses different parts of our brain and affects our beliefs in ways that other modes of expression do not.41 The act of committing things to writing has been shown to be critical both in changing a person’s mind42 and in making imagined stories feel more real.43
                    - Write about your life as though an outside person was describing it. Focus on all of your positive aspects as a human.
                    - Write about your occupation and the people you are surrounded by in your workplace. Give a description of some of your most meaningful personal relationships and consider the good things these people would say about you. Find positive things that have happened today no matter the size or significance.
                    - Take the time to write down this narrative. Just thinking about it won’t be as effective.
                    - For daily practice, we highly recommend the gratitude journals from Intelligent Change. You’ll find the link in the resources section of this book.
                    - One of Olivia’s favorite clients decided to try the gratitude tools with his entire family. Initially, they were skeptical. “I thought it was a little goofy, like Thanksgiving when we all go around the table and talk about what we are giving thanks for that year,” his wife said.
                    - Robert was glad his family was joining him for the journey because it gave him the discipline to keep at it.
                    - The results, he is happy to report, were dramatic. Now, before any of the family members complain about something, they’ll pause to first say out loud why they are grateful. This experience has helped them develop more appreciation for what’s going well in their lives, and reframe negative experiences as positive ones.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Morning Gratitude
                    - The next time you wake up in the morning, try this exercise to access gratitude.
                    - You’re waking up in the morning. First, you breathe. Think about that: you are breathing. Countless geological miracles had to happen in order for you to breathe. Just the right mixture of gases had to be present to make life possible. And, for that matter, you just happen to be living on a planet that is exactly the right distance from our star, not too close, not too far, just right for humans to live comfortably. Any closer and it would be like Venus, far too hot for life to exist; any farther out and it would be like Mars, just too cold for life to survive.
                    - And then, as Bill Bryson puts it: “Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion years [going right back to the first microbes on Earth] . . . every one of your forebears on both sides has been . . . healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate and circumstances to live long enough to do so.”44
                    - Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from their life’s quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result—eventually, astoundingly—in you.
                    - Now, you open your eyes. Think of the miracle, of all the little rods and cones that allow you to see. Think of the incredibly complex mechanical systems that must work in order for you to be able to move, to get out of bed.
                    - Your bed. That’s another thing to be grateful for. As is your bedroom. You have a roof over your head. And if you flip a switch to turn on the light, think of all that’s come before you, to make electricity not just possible, but incredibly convenient. You make a small movement, and suddenly there is light. For most of human history, right up until the last two hundred years or so, such a power was considered to be absolutely godly.
                    - Are you heading to the bathroom? Turning a tap? That’s pure, clean water coming out. More than 700 million people in this world do not have access to clean water—that’s one in nine people. You have not just access, but easy access to clean water. Plenty of clean water. As much as you like. But wait—it’s not just clean water. You have the luxury of hot water. Without boiling it, without building a fire—all you have to do is turn a tap. Think of all the feats of engineering that have been necessary for that to happen.
                    - And all this, even before your first cup of coffee. Can you imagine the number of things that have happened to make breakfast possible? All the people, processes, systems that were slowly, ever so slowly built over the years? All the innovations that have taken place in order for the food and drink you desire to so conveniently be waiting for you in your kitchen?
                    - Did you open the refrigerator to get some milk? That’s a refrigerator you’ve got there, my friend. A miracle of modern technology. Speak to anyone from before 1913 and they would simply not believe you. You are so rich that you can afford your very own personal electric cooling chamber? With light?
                    - In fact, before 1834, what you are taking for granted in your kitchen would’ve seemed as magical as teleportation seems to us. Think of it: having a refrigerator in your kitchen would seem to the vast majority of humans in history like having a personal teleportation portal inside your home.
                    - All this to be grateful for. Awed and amazed by. And you still haven’t sat down for breakfast.
                - Self-forgiveness and Self-compassion
                    - The creativity needed for breakthroughs cannot flourish in a self-critical brain. Research has demonstrated time and again that fear of judgment, whether from others or from oneself, impairs creativity. Interestingly, self-criticism was particularly harmful to creativity.45
                    - What’s the antidote to self-judgment and self-criticism? Self-forgiveness. Though it might sound like “fluff,” it’s actually a cornerstone of the training of people whose performance lives and dies by hard numbers: athletes.
                    - “Athletes who get injured often blame themselves for getting injured,” Dr. JoAnn Dahlkoetter, a sports psychologist who has coached five Olympic gold medalists and the author of Your Performing Edge, explained. “That blame, shame, and guilt slows down the healing. This is where self-forgiveness is so important.”46
                    - As you know, skillfully handling failure means both rebounding from and learning from each failure. To do this, you have to be able to stay in a productive mental state. This isn’t easy, because our natural tendency when failure hits is to beat ourselves up. 
                    - In the course of researching this book, we discovered that the self-compassion techniques used to quiet the inner critic when aiming for charisma are just as effective to quiet the inner critic on the road to breakthroughs. What follows is adapted from Olivia’s first book, The Charisma Myth.
                    - Self-forgiveness, though uncomfortable for many of us, is an essential practice for breakthrough thinking. Without self-compassion, you can kill the breakthrough experience before it begins.
                    - First, let’s distinguish three key concepts:
                        - Self-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something.
                        - Self-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It’s often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval).
                        - Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience.
                    - It’s quite possible for people to have high self-confidence but low self-esteem or self-compassion. They may consider themselves competent, masterful even, but that does not translate into liking themselves. These people can be exceedingly hard on themselves when they don’t succeed.
                    - Behavioral science research indicates that it may be healthier to focus on self-compassion than on self-esteem, because the latter is based on self-evaluation and social comparison.47 Self-esteem is more of a roller coaster, contingent on how we believe we compare to others. It also tends to correlate with narcissism. Self-compassion, in contrast, is based on self-acceptance, and “self-compassion does all the good things that self-esteem was supposed to do,” says Wharton professor of management and psychology Adam Grant.*
                    - Individuals who score high on self-compassion scales display greater emotional resilience and fewer negative reactions to life’s difficulties, such as receiving unflattering feedback.48 Higher self-compassion correlates to a greater sense of personal responsibility for the outcome of events; it helps predict levels of accountability. People who score high on self-compassion also have a lower tendency for denial. This makes sense: personal mistakes would generate less self-criticism, so people would be more willing to admit to them.
                    - In many cultures people often associate the term “self-compassion” with self-indulgence or self-pity. Surprisingly, the opposite is true: solid behavioral science research shows that the higher one’s level of self-compassion, the lower one’s level of self-pity.49
                    - You can think of the difference between the two this way: self-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair. Self-pity can lead to resentment or bitterness, and to feeling more isolated and alienated. In contrast, self-compassion often leads to increased feelings of connectedness.
                    - Another assumption we often hear is: “But if I stop beating myself up, won’t I lose the motivation to keep growing? My inner critic, never satisfied, always telling me I can do better, that’s what drives me to success! I don’t want to lose that!”
                    - People find motivation and drive in different ways. To motivate themselves when facing a challenge, many are driven by a voice in their head, a critical voice they react to, trying to prove it wrong, quiet it, challenge it, or run from it. Such people often tell us that they’re afraid that if they lose this self-critical part of themselves, they will lose their drive. For some people, this is true. Some people push themselves to their breakthroughs by being in a relationship with their critical part. That’s okay.
                    - If you are one of these people, then by all means stay in a relationship with this aspect of yourself. Let it continue to drive you forward into unknown lands and breakthrough ideas. The thing to be mindful of is that you are critical of your ideas and processes rather than of yourself.
                    - Should you be so confident about this idea? Is it a good idea? Is it truly a breakthrough? Might you do a little more research or experimenting to be sure it’s truly a breakthrough? Do some more associative thinking? Rather than destroying your confidence, a constructive critical voice pushes back on any tendency you have to sit back and say “that’s good enough.”
                    - However, for some people the internal critic attacks and destroys their self-confidence and willingness to try new things. For some people, that critical voice is paralyzing and often kills interesting thoughts before they’ve even begun. That critical part can, in some people, take the energy needed for breakthrough thinking and redirect it to finding ever more things to criticize about the self. For those people, the inner critical voice is an obstacle to breakthrough thinking, not a motivator.
                    - No one is immune from the paralyzing force of the inner critic. We will all face times when a series of things will go wrong, “just one damn thing after another,” all in a row, and our fortitude will be tested. At such times, tools like self-forgiveness and self-compassion can be saving graces.
                    - Self-compassion delivers an impressive array of benefits: decreased anxiety, depression, and self-criticism; improved relationships and greater feelings of social connectedness and satisfaction with life; increased ability to handle negative events; and even improved immune system functioning.50
                    - Sounds great, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, self-compassion isn’t taught in school. In fact, in today’s culture it sounds indulgent and unjustified, and can feel very alien. Many of us don’t have a very clear idea of what it is to begin with.
                    - Kristin Neff, one of compassion’s foremost researchers, defines self-compassion as a three-step process: First, realizing that we’re experiencing difficulties. Second, responding with kindness and understanding toward ourselves when we are suffering or feel inadequate, rather than being harshly self-critical. Third, realizing that whatever we’re going through is commonly experienced by all human beings, and remembering that everyone goes through difficult times like these.
                    - When things go wrong in our lives, it’s easy to assume that other people are having an easier time. Recognizing instead that everyone at some point has had or will have the very experience you’re having now can help you feel like part of the larger human experience rather than isolated and alienated.
                    - When our inner critic starts pointing out our misdeeds and imperfections, it will often make us feel that everyone else is doing better, that we’re the only ones who are this flawed. Self-criticism is much stronger when our suffering seems due to our own perceived failures and inadequacies than when it seems due to external circumstances. This is when self-compassion is the most precious.
                    - One incredibly powerful self-compassion practice we know is a millennia-old Buddhist one called Metta, which roughly translates as “loving-kindness.” Metta is the deliberate practice of developing kind intentions toward all beings.
                    - When the brains of dedicated Metta practitioners were examined and tested by neuroscientists, significant differences came to light. Not only did they emit deeper brain waves, they also bounced back from stress scenarios much faster, and they showed particular enhancement in the left frontal lobe of their cortices, the “happy region” of the brain.51
                    - You may remember that earlier we wrote that it is often effective to quiet the inhibiting frontal lobes to increase the likelihood of a breakthrough. Why then are we suggesting a practice to strengthen the frontal lobes?
                    - By making us happier and more loving towards ourselves, the practice of Metta quiets our inner critic. When our inner critic is quieter, we are more likely to achieve a breakthrough. So while Metta enhances our frontal lobes, it also changes them, making them less prone to inhibit our thinking.
                    - Another interesting part of this is that while the act of meditating shuts down the DN, meditation actually strengthens the brain regions—and the connections between them—that make up the DN. So you probably won’t have a breakthrough while meditating, but meditating will strengthen your DN and make it more likely that you’ll have one when you’re wandering and you enter the breakthrough state of mind.
                    - Metta is a wonderful way to counter your inner critic’s attacks. It is, however, a highly uncomfortable practice for many of us. When Olivia started it, it was more than uncomfortable—it was downright awkward. Even if it feels weird for you, too, do it anyway.
                    - First, a Metta warm-up adapted from Neff’s work. Pick someone for whom you have tremendous affection. In fact, it could be a person, a pet, or even a stuffed animal. Now imagine the two of you as a unit, facing the world together. And now, see if you can wish this unit well: “May we be happy. May we be safe from harm.” Use whatever words feel comfortable for you.
                    - The visualization below will guide you through a customized form of Metta step-by-step. It has been crafted to take advantage of two instinctive human tendencies: our absorption of images and our respect for authority. If you’d prefer to hear Olivia guide you through this exercise, you’ll find a recording online at www.TheButterfly.net. Throughout this exercise, you may notice a certain rhythm created by the repetitions. That is indeed their purpose; just be willing to give it a try.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Metta
                        - Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing in masses of clean air toward the top of your head; then let it whoosh through you from head to toe as you exhale, washing all concerns away.
                        - Think of any occasion in your life when you performed a good deed, however great or small. Just one good action—one moment of truth, generosity, or courage. Focus on that memory for a moment.
                        - Now think of one being, whether present or past, mythical or actual—Jesus, Buddha, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama—who could have great affection for you. This could be a person, a pet, or even a stuffed animal.
                        - Picture this being in your mind. Imagine their warmth, their kindness and compassion. See it in their eyes and face. Feel their warmth radiating toward you, enveloping you.
                        - See yourself through their eyes with warmth, kindness, and compassion. Feel them giving you complete forgiveness for everything your inner critic says is wrong. You are completely and absolutely forgiven. You have a clean slate.
                        - Feel them giving you wholehearted acceptance. You are accepted as you are, right now, at this stage of growth, imperfections and all.
                    - After going through the Metta exercise, our clients often report a physical sense of relief, their shoulders sagging during the forgiveness visualization, and then warmth rising during the self-approval process. Many people feel warmth in their solar plexus region. Some describe a kind of “exquisite ache,” or feeling “very tender.” No matter what you experience, if you are feeling anything, it means it’s working.
                    - Even when the experience itself doesn’t “feel” like it’s working, Metta is worth doing because of the spillover effect it produces. Often, though the exercise itself feels disconcerting, you will notice throughout the rest of the day that you are more present, connecting better with others, and better able to absorb and enjoy the good moments in your life. As self-compassion researcher and author of The Mindful Path to Self-Compassion Christopher Germer puts it: “A moment of self-compassion like this can change your entire day. A string of such moments can change the course of your life.”52
                    - You can use Metta visualization anytime you experience an attack of the internal critic. As Germer suggests, you can think of self-compassion as standing up to self-harm the same way you’d stand up to something threatening a loved one.
                    - Researchers who started experimenting with these kinds of visualizations with highly self-critical people reported “significant reductions in depression, anxiety, self-criticism, shame, and inferiority,” while noting a “significant increase in feelings of warmth and reassurance for the self.”53
                    - Now that you know how to handle the fear of failure, let’s look at how to handle the experience of failure itself.
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - Fear and anxiety are major inhibitors of breakthroughs.
                    - Catastrophizing only serves to strengthen our negativity bias and shut us down to breakthroughs.
                    - Failure is unavoidable and natural. We must learn to handle our fear of it.
                    - With intentional breakthroughs, fear appears on the road to breakthrough, focused on failure; with unintentional breakthroughs, fear occurs after the breakthrough, focused on implementation.
                    - Common manifestations of the fear of failure are:
                    - The impostor syndrome: the fear that you will be exposed as a fraud. Solution: create a new self-image and support it with concrete evidence.
                    - The inner critic: the voice in your head beating you up. Solution: find out who you actually mean when you tell yourself “everybody” does this, then create a new “everybody” to think of instead.
                    - The perfectionist: the feeling that you’re never good enough, never doing enough. Solution: know that mistakes are precious and that others like your imperfection.
                    - The maximizer: the drive to do better than everyone else, to do more. Solution: place limits on how far you are willing to go.
                    - Fear is best handled with relaxation, gratitude, self-forgiveness, and self-compassion.
            - Chapter 8: The Failure Wasps
                - Letting Go of Shame
                - SO WHAT, EXACTLY, is it that we fear? Of course, we fear the actual consequences of failure, whether tangible or intangible, whether they are in the form of money, time, effort, or reputation, among other things. But we also fear the experience itself.
                - And it’s no wonder: for many of us, the internal experience of failure is one of shame, dismay, disappointment, or even despair. Understandably, this isn’t something we look forward to. This is where failure skills come in. Failure skills ensure that you stay in a learning mode, the right psychological state to learn everything there is to learn from this failure and to rebound fast so you can try again.
                - Many of the sports psychologists and coaches we interviewed consider failure as a mini-trauma. Dr. Wes Sime, a sport psychologist with two PhDs, in sports science and peak performance psychology, told us: “Athletes actually suffer microtraumas: the embarrassment of having ‘blown it’ in front of an audience; possibly the embarrassment and shame of having let your team down.” And then there’s the potential blow to your earning power, loss of future sponsorships, and so forth.
                - Failure comes in different flavors. The four categories below represent a descending order of knowledge and control. For instance, category [1](1.md) means you had full knowledge and full control. Category [2](2.md) means you had imperfect knowledge but full control. And so forth.
                - You may need different remedies. Self-generated failure may need self-forgiveness. Externally generated failure may need the “resentment letter” technique.
                - This chapter will give you the tools you need to become more resilient to failure. Resiliency to failure is a subset of the broader category of resiliency to hardship. Failure is a form of hardship, one of many that we can experience. If you are resilient to failure, you are less affected by it and bounce back faster. This has a bonus effect: since you know you’ve got the skills to handle failure and are now more resilient to it, you’ll be less afraid of it.
                - Reframing, or The Baby in the Backseat
                    - Imagine that it’s 9 P.M. on a Monday evening, after a long and tedious day at work, and you’re finally driving home as darkness sets in. It’s your significant other’s birthday, and you’ve been planning the evening for months. Despite your tiredness, you’re smiling as you look forward to the evening, happily anticipating spending some quality time together.
                    - Suddenly, a large red sedan comes screeching into your lane out of nowhere. With your heart pounding and your hands gripping the steering wheel, you slam on the brakes. Not only did the driver cut you off, he’s now swerved out of your lane, making the car to your right screech its tires. “What an idiot! Reckless driver!” you think as anger surges through your veins.
                    - Your physical response to this encounter is the very definition of the fight-or-flight response. It causes your heart rate to increase as your muscles tighten. Your body is overcome with stress-induced hormones, overrun with the stress and anger that this event has generated. You cannot bring these emotions home with you. Unfortunately, you have only a few minutes to recover from this experience, and the powerful impression it has left on your mind will not subside easily.
                    - Once the fight-or-flight response is aroused, it’s hard to quiet down. Anger is a difficult emotion to flush out of our system, which is why an unpleasant traffic encounter in the morning can stay on our minds for hours and sometimes all day.
                    - If you aimed to simply suppress the anger, you would be paying a high price. When people are induced into a negative emotional state and then asked to suppress negative emotions, their internal negative experience often remains unchanged and they sustain elevated stress responses in their brain and cardiovascular system.1 Emotion suppression works as poorly as thought suppression.
                    - But what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver, who was driving so erratically, was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat? She was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane, while reaching back to save her baby’s life.
                    - Would that immediately reduce your anger?
                    - For most people it does.
                    - If you decide to change your perception of events (this is technically called cognitive reappraisal, but we prefer to call it reframing), you will effectively decrease your brain’s stress levels. Researchers using fMRI machines at Stanford concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a “far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.”2
                    - We rarely know for certain what motivates a person’s actions, so why not choose the explanation that is most helpful to us? Create a version of events that gets you into the mental states you need for breakthrough thinking. Though it may sound outlandish at first, choosing to reframe your perspective is actually the smartest and most rational thing to do.
                    - Let’s say you’re going to check on the sales of a new product you’ve just offered, and the results are dismal. If you go into a spiral of self-criticism and self-doubt, you know what happens: you’re no longer in a rational learning mode, so you won’t be able to accurately parse out reasons and consequences, causes and effects.
                    - Reframing means simply switching the frame through which you view an experience or an event. It’s changing your mind about the way you describe an experience.
                    - Cognitive reframing is a rational, logic-based argument: “Here’s why it’s not as bad as you think.” Social proof reframing, in contrast, does not need any logic; it says, “This happens to a lot of people” or even better yet, “This admired figure had this experience too.”
                    - Here’s a great example of cognitive reframing. One of our collaborators told us: “My husband likes to buy and resell art for side money. His mentor, an expert in the field, advised my husband not to look at a bad purchase decision as a loss or deficit, but to consider it tuition, since this trade is not one you can go to school to learn. So he views his botched purchases as a tuition of sorts that he would have had to pay had he chosen art as a full-time career. And considering the current rate of college tuition, he has lots of room for error (aka learning).”
                    - This is a fantastic reframe: don’t see the outcome as a possible failure, but rather as guaranteed learning. And that learning will lead either to a pivot or to the end of the road. Imagine that, when the outcome happens and it’s not the one you were hoping for, it’s like a pinball machine saying, “Congratulations, you’ve learned something and you get to play again!” In this frame, the end of the road (success) is actually the less attractive option, because you don’t get to play again!
                    - Sometimes our clients ask us: “How do we balance the hope that our efforts will achieve successful innovation with the probability that each attempt will fail? It can’t be right to assume failure, because motivation then becomes an issue.”
                    - We tell them: See each attempt as guaranteed learning. No matter what happens, you’ll learn. You’ll learn, as Edison did, countless ways to not invent the lightbulb. The answer is to see learning as the ultimate prize. You may have heard of the “growth mindset,” also called the “learning stance.”3
                    - Take a longer-term view of your efforts. You are not looking to succeed at this one thing right in front of you. You are looking to succeed at making yourself a fantastic innovator. In this mental frame, nothing is a step backward, because you are always learning something new. Sometimes all you learn is “don’t do that again.” But that’s still a step forward.
                    - Let’s say you’re Edison working on finding a commercially viable lightbulb. And let’s say, for the sake of argument, that there are 10,000 possible filaments. You manage to narrow that down to 1,600 by selecting only materials with high resistance at low energies. Now the testing begins. The chances are that each test will fail. But a learning stance, a growth mindset, looks at each failure and says, “I am now one step closer to finding the right one.” You obtained guaranteed learning.
                    - When Elon Musk’s SpaceX attempted to land a rocket back on a barge in the ocean so it could be reused, the landing failed. But even though the landing didn’t end in success, the fact that the rocket hit the barge at all is extremely encouraging. As Musk puts it, this “failure” “bodes well for the future.”4 You can do this too: see the failure as “guaranteed learning,“ and therefore something that bodes well for the future. It helps maintain emotional momentum.
                    - Astro Teller recommends that instead of seeing what you put out into the world as a final product, imagine that you’re saying to the world: “What do you think? How can we make this better?” As he told us, “It’s much better to find out now what we missed than to find out years from now, with an incredible amount of additional expense and emotional investment.”5
                    - In some cases, a great way to get yourself into a “willing to fail” mindset is to see whatever you are doing as an experiment, something you’re just trying once, with no commitment to follow through, and to phrase it to yourself as “it’s interesting and I’m curious.” For example, if you’re trying a new behavior and someone comments on it, you can simply say, “It’s a social experiment,” and perhaps even mention an article about it, which distances the potentially embarrassment-triggering part of the experiment from your social identity.
                    - Creativity expert Tina Seelig likes this saying: “Genius is the ability to make the most mistakes in the shortest period of time.”6 As she explains, each of those mistakes provides experimental data and an opportunity to learn something new. She, too, suggests changing our vocabulary from “failures” to “data,“ to enhance your (and others’) willingness to experiment.
                    - In her wonderful book inGenius, which we highly recommend to anyone interested in creativity, she explains that master inventors appreciate unexpected outcomes such as failures, because each one teaches them something important on the road to a breakthrough idea. They believe it’s up to each of us to mine our failures for valuable information and insights. The key is seeing the process of trial and error as a series of experiments on the way to a success.
                    - Take a hint from Silicon Valley and don’t call it a failure, call it a pivot. Feel how different the word sounds and feels. Changing the language is one of the many ways they destigmatize failure; another way is to glorify it. Venture capitalist Randy Komisar says, “Silicon Valley recognizes that failure is an unavoidable part of the search for success.”7
                - Detaching
                    - In order to handle failure well, you need to learn how to detach from the thoughts and emotions it can evoke. The key to detaching? Realizing that: just because it’s in your head doesn’t mean it’s true. Just because it feels true doesn’t mean it is true.
                    - Negative thoughts have power over you because you believe that what your brain is giving you is an accurate portrait of reality. This, however, is not true. Your brain often looks at the world through a distorted lens.
                    - In one well-known study, Harvard researchers asked the participants to watch a short video in which two groups of people passed around a basketball. They were asked to count the number of passes made by one of the teams. Partway through the video, a woman walked onto the court wearing a full gorilla suit.
                    - After watching the video, the participants were asked if they saw anything out of the ordinary take place. In most groups more than half missed the gorilla even though it had waved its arms at the camera!8
                    - We know what you’re thinking, you’d do better? Let’s see:
                    - Take a look around the room you’re in. Notice everything that’s black.
                    - Now you’re looking at this page again. Good. Keep your eyes here. Without looking up, try to name everything you saw that was red.
                    - Go ahead. We’ll wait.
                    
. . .
                    - Okay, take a look around again.
                    - Now do you see a lot of things that are red?
                    - Interesting, right?
                    - So why did this happen? Our brains have a lot to do. There is limited space dedicated to conscious attention. This constrains the amount of information we can be aware of at any one time. If the visual world is an ocean of information, then at any one time we only consciously perceive a small creek. The ocean would overwhelm us.
                    - So our brains focus on information they consider relevant. Our brains make choices about what to pay attention to. Those choices mean we miss things, and that means our brains do not provide us with an accurate representation of reality. Our worldviews are incomplete.
                    - Most of the time our brains make good choices and we draw a fairly accurate portrait of reality. But there are times when our minds distort reality. Often this distortion skews negative because our brains, in an effort to keep us safe, finds negative elements the most relevant. It’s the negativity bias we talked about in the previous chapter.
                    - Diane is a young project manager in charge of the biggest project of her career. Shortly after the project begins, she gets a call from Sarah, her point of contact with the client. Sarah tells her, “I think you’re incredible at your job. I’ve been raving about you and your excellent work for the past year. My boss doesn’t seem to get it. My best guess is he just wasn’t impressed when you guys first met, and he hasn’t gotten a chance to change his mind. That being said, I’d like you, Diane, to be in charge of all our company’s projects. Your work is so good, I’m sure my boss will be wowed when he sees it. I want you to present your work at the company’s next management meeting.”
                    - Sarah said many positive things about Diane—that she’s incredible at her job, does excellent work, that she’s being put in charge of all the projects. But what Diane’s brain finds most relevant is the one negative piece: Sarah’s boss wasn’t impressed with her. If you’ve ever found yourself stuck on the one negative piece of information you heard in a conversation, you know how devastating it can be to your confidence.
                    - The mind evolved to worry about everything that could potentially go wrong. In this sense, the mind is like the Jewish mother who sends you a telegram saying, “Start worrying. Details to follow.” Or as psychologist Steven Hayes put it, “Hello, this is your mind speaking. Do you realize you need to worry?”9
                    - Detaching is essential for handling the inner critic. Rather than being the voice in your head, it becomes one of many, which we all have. To maximize detaching, you can even give the inner critic a name and character—call it Oscar the Grouch or Dennis the Menace, and see it as a childlike cartoon character.
                    - When you find yourself stuck on a negative piece of information and spiraling down, remind yourself that your perception of reality is more than likely off. If negative information was put in front of it, your brain will focus on it, following its negativity bias. It is likely declaring the negative elements relevant and omitting some positives entirely.
                    - Putting It into Practice: Fear No More
                    - The techniques below are designed to help you quiet the effects of negative thoughts. Notice which ones work best for you, and practice until they become a reflex.
                        - Don’t give your thoughts the benefit of the doubt. Sure, they’re yours. But that doesn’t mean they’re accurate. Start from the notion that you probably missed a lot of things and there are positive elements waiting to be noticed.
                        - Imagine your thoughts like graffiti on a wall.
                        - Name what you are experiencing: anger, anxiety, self-criticism. Naming what you are experiencing can help you neutralize it.
                        - Make it less personal. Don’t say, “I’m feeling ashamed.” Instead say, “There is shame being felt.” Take a step back. Observe the experience like an anthropologist observing a ritual. Imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “Fascinating. There are self-critical thoughts happening.”
                        - Imagine looking at the Earth from space. Now come closer, see your country, your neighborhood, your house. Here you are, this one person, having this experience on this planet right now.
                        - Imagine your negative thoughts are a podcast. Take off your headphones, set your music player aside.
                        - Lay out what it would look like if everything you’re worried about happens, if everything that can go wrong does. Now notice that you survived this scenario.
                        - Remember all the times before when you felt a similar negativity or anxiety. You didn’t think you’d make it through then. And yet you did.
                    - The skill is in knowing how to handle the negative thoughts, rather than trying to suppress them or argue with them.
                    - Steven Hayes and his colleagues asked a group of subjects to not think of yellow Jeeps for a few minutes. Some subjects described the immediate appearance of yellow Jeeps. Other were able to suppress the thought for a short time, but the yellow Jeeps roared into their brains. The participants were thinking about yellow Jeeps for days and sometimes weeks afterward.
                    - Because trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to aim to neutralize it.
                    - Destigmatizing an experience means reducing its power by simply understanding that it’s normal, common, and nothing to be ashamed of. By doing so, you lift the stigma of shame off the experience, which is critical, because when in shame, you can’t think straight.
                    - Our minds’ natural tendency when encountering failure is to imagine the absolute worst-case scenario. With social proof, you can understand that “everyone” or “most people” go through this experience.
                    - The way we react to failure is actually very similar to the way we react to grief. Grief is the feeling of something precious irretrievably lost; failure is a loss of something you presumably cared a lot about. The best way to understand grief is through a sequence known as the Kübler-Ross model.
                        - Denial: “This cannot have happened.” “There must be a mistake.”
                        - Anger: When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, he becomes frustrated. “How the #$%! can this have happened?” “Who screwed up?”
                        - Bargaining: “There must be a way to make this un-happen. Maybe if we . . .”
                        - Depression: “It really happened.” “We failed. We suck. We might as well give up.”
                        - Acceptance: “Okay, we failed. Now what?” Acceptance is the last stage before moving on.
                    - We can’t avoid this dip in happiness, productivity, and creativity, but we can reduce its depth and duration by accepting it rather than fighting against it. As Shawn Achor told us: “The more you accept the inevitable post-failure productivity dip, the faster you’ll move through it.”10
                    - Dr. JoAnn Dahlkoetter told us: “It is absolutely critical to go through the stages of grief, to process those stages of anger, sadness, and so forth. Grief, when ignored, can lead to depression.” Dahlkoetter remarked that very few teams or organizations take the time to grieve when a project fails. Instead, they try to move right on, as if the failure hadn’t had any emotional impact. “Unfortunately, repressing feelings just makes things worse,” she told us.
                    - You need a mourning process: whether it’s a business opportunity or a gold medal that was lost, it’s important to take the time to grieve, to mourn the failure before you try to learn from it. You’ll be tempted to skip right past these uncomfortable feelings. Our instinct, whenever we feel discomfort, is to grab onto the first thing we think will make the discomfort go away. In this case, wanting to avoid the blues of mourning the failure, and knowing that being in a productive mode feels better, presents us with a big temptation to go straight from acknowledging the failure to analyzing it.11
                    - But don’t. Grieving a failure is a different process from analyzing it. Grieving a failure is an emotional process, one of acceptance. “This happened.” We move through the grief not by asking why this happened or figuring out how it could have been prevented. Yes, after the grief, you will analyze the failure and learn from it, but that analysis is an intellectual process, not an emotional one.
                    - “This is a particularly common trap for type As, who might tend to view grief/mourning failure as weakness—and I speak from personal experience,” explains technologist and entrepreneur Safi Bahcall.*
                    - So how does one grieve for a failure? Depending on the emotional impact of the particular failure, it could be as simple as taking a few moments to acknowledge the disappointment, all the way to a full-blown mourning process. Dr. Dahlkoetter recommends to her athletes, as we do with our clients, that they write down their thoughts and feelings. They need to express their anger, whether it’s at themselves or at someone else (for instance, a relay teammate who dropped the baton).
                    - Here are some ways she helps Olympians handle failure:
                        - Put things in perspective. Look back ten years from now. How much will it matter then?
                        - Focus on behavior, not outcome. Find something they did right. Did they keep good form, for example?
                        - When we fail, we’re often asking negative questions, usually starting with “Why?”—including “Why am I an idiot?” 
                    - That fires up the inner critic. Positive questions start with “What” or “How.” What can I learn from this experience? What’s good about what just happened? How can I use this situation to my advantage? What’s the next step? How can I keep moving forward? What tools and resources do I need to keep moving forward?
                    - To get closure on a failure, neuroscientist Richard Wiseman suggests a three-step process we firmly approve of:
                        - Write it down: pour out onto paper everything that’s on your mind, everything that weighs on your heart. What happened, how you felt—this is a mental purge, or as some of our clients call it, a “vomit sprint.”
                        - Rip it up: with gusto and enthusiasm. Really get into the motions, hear the ripping, feel the tearing.
                        - Burn it, if you can, and officially declare the failure closed.
                - Reframing Using Social Proof
                    - Ever notice how when one person starts dancing, they look like a maniac, but when twenty people start dancing, we assume it’s Improv Everywhere?
                    - Another kind of reframing uses the aforementioned social proof principle: finding admired figures who have failed, are willing to fail again, and who, in fact, integrate failure as an expected part of their process. The fact that an admired authority figure approves of failure (or whichever experience you want to destigmatize) makes it “all right.”
                    - Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
                    - —Albert Einstein
                    - Try to find at least five examples of failure. The human brain thinks in triads (from Olympic medals to fairy tales, it’s three medals, three princes, three bears), and it cannot immediately comprehend numbers greater than four.12 Past that number, the mind turns the number into “a lot” or, in this case, “everybody.”
                    - You can pick these examples from anywhere. Celebrities and peers will hit the social proof lever; authority figures will hit the authority lever. For best results, include all the different ways we absorb information: radio and podcast interviews, YouTube videos, books, letters, e-mails—find in any of these media examples of people talking about their failures. You want to bathe in that environment so that your brain gets the impression that the world around you thinks in this manner.
                    - For example, you could remind yourself that almost every successful innovative person, just like Edison, integrates failure as a necessary part of their process.13 You could tell yourself that failure is such an inherent part of innovation that Edison distrusted innovation without failure. In fact, when he first listened to the playback of his recorded voice on his phonograph he was worried. “I was always afraid of things that worked the first time.”
                    - Safi Bahcall recalls a quote from golfer Michelle Wie’s coach, who instructed her to repeat to herself whenever she missed a putt: “I’ve gotten that out of the way. Now I’m one step closer to becoming the best putter in the history of golf.” “I often think of that quote when I screw up,” says Bahcall.
                    - As Andy Ouderkirk, corporate scientist at 3M, told us: “Self-doubt is a natural part of breakthrough innovation, and there is usually little affirmation from others early in the process. Understand that self-doubt suggests that you are indeed likely working on a breakthrough idea. If you have doubts, others probably do as well, which is probably why the opportunity for a breakthrough still exists. I’ve learned that inventions that create little skepticism at the onset almost never end up being very useful. The ones that were most challenged led to the largest businesses. I now put much more energy into the inventions that create skepticism!”14
                    - You could one day learn to see that feeling of doubt as a reassuring one, a sign that you’re on the right track. Doubt is a signpost on the road to something new, a natural part of the journey to a breakthrough. If no one had doubts, they’d all have done it already!
                    - And, of course, you can combine social proof reframing with pure cognitive reframing. Edison is said to have failed ten thousand times on his way to inventing the commercially viable lightbulb. When asked how he could persevere through a thousand failures, he answered that he didn’t see it as “a thousand failures.”15 Instead, he had simply found a thousand ways to not invent this lightbulb. Eventually, the commercial lightbulb was invented.
                    - If this had been phrased as: “Edison determined, from a comprehensive search of materials and conditions in over ten thousand trials, an experimentally refined construction of the lightbulb,” the perception of those unsuccessful trials changes instantly.
                    - The rephrasing of ten thousand failures as ten thousand trials is cognitive reframe. The fact that this sentence was said by Edison? That’s social proof.
                - A Special Note for Those of You Who Lead Teams and Organizations
                    - This is where you play a critical role as leaders. Because as leaders, people turn to you to understand how they should feel about something. As leaders, you are by definition the alphas of your pack. People will look to you for cues as to how they should view events and react to situations.
                    - If you can tell them what to expect, how their brain will react to failure, which emotions they might feel, and what pitfalls to watch out for, they won’t be as unsettled when it happens.
                    - Why was Edison able to stay confident and focused after his first failure? It was six years between the debacle of his voting machine and the success of his broadband telegraph. That’s six years of concepts not working. Six years of failure. But to Edison’s way of thinking, “If I find 10,000 ways something won’t work, I haven’t failed. I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is a step forward.”
                    - Practice Failure
                    - Under duress, we seldom rise to our level of expectation. Instead, we fall back to our level of training. This is why we train.—Army motto
                    - When you go to the gym, you don’t immediately pick up the 300-pound barbells. You work your way up to them. Practice is trying out a new behavior in a low-stakes scenario, a safe environment; it is trying out a much smaller version of that behavior, a baby step. This is precisely what you need to do with failure: practice it in low-stakes, safe scenarios, to gradually increase your ability to handle it.
                    - There are two kinds of practice: physical and mental. Physical practice is the one most people think of first: actually experiencing something in real life. Mental practice is going through whatever experience you’re practicing—in your head.
                    - We’ll cover real-life, experiential practice first.
                    - Experiential Practice
                    - All the tools we cover in this section help you rewire your response to failure, but they play on different mechanisms to get there. Some modes of reframing, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, are purely a logical, cognitive assertion; the EN is at work here.
                    - Others, such as social proof, are more emotional. It is an instinctive response to an observed social behavior, whether or not one understands any logic behind it. When a train stops and everyone gets out and starts going in the same direction, you will instinctively go with the flow, move with the herd. Social proof can work even when the behavior that is approved of doesn’t make sense—such as when an admired or authority figure models an illogical behavior.
                    - Now, there is a difference between failing in private and failing in public. There are, in fact, a few stages on that spectrum: being all alone, being with a small group of friends where you feel safe, being with strangers, and being the center of a large group. You don’t want to start with karaoke right off the bat! Get to know your own personal reactions to failure in a safe environment, where you are practicing failure, so that they won’t take you by surprise when a real failure happens.
                    - We’re going to cover a few different ways of practicing failure.
                    - Sports
                    - Sports are a fantastic way to practice failure, and thus build resiliency to failure. Smart companies recognize it and make the most of it. Google, for example, knows that their employees must experience frequent failures on the road to breakthrough innovation, so they specifically seek people with a high resiliency to failure.
                    - One of the Google recruiters described interviewing a candidate who used to play professional baseball, and who told him: “I know how to fail. I’ve struck out a million times. Literally.” He hired him on the spot. Another Google executive told us: “I have a few baseball players on my team. They’re all successful.”
                    - Poker
                    - Poker is a phenomenal training ground for handling failure. Poker players have to accept that they’re going to lose a certain percentage of the time. World Series of Poker winner Annie Duke says, “It has to be okay to lose, because losing will happen,” no matter how good you are.16
                    - Poker can help you learn how to bounce back from a failure. “You can’t analyze or ruminate in the moment; that’s not the time for it. You have to snap out of it because the next hand is coming up, and if you’re still angry at fate, others, or yourself, you’re going to play the next hand poorly. Tell yourself that you’ll put a pin in it and analyze it later.”
                    - Annie explained that in poker when you analyze your decision after the fact you are not looking at whether you won or lost. Whether you win any particular hand in poker is very random. There are just so many things you don’t know. You analyze your decision to see whether you understood the odds and probable outcomes as well as you could have, and whether you made the right decision according to this understanding.
                    - Cooking
                    - Cooking is especially useful because you get to practice failure and creativity at the same time. Neuroscientist Marie Pasinski is a big fan of this kind of experiential practice, and recommends The Blue Strawberry Cookbook, a cookbook without recipes that encourages you to be innovative and experiment. Cooking is also where Olivia practices failure.
                    - Olivia’s kitchen often looks like a crime scene—after particularly creative experiments, there is food everywhere, including the walls. She firmly believes that the amount of creativity generated is in direct proportion to the amount of mess made, and the word most often heard in her kitchen is “Whoops!” She once decided to “improve” tzatziki, a Greek yogurt and dill dish, with oranges and salami. She insists that she was doing fine until she added the salami. Thankfully, Olivia’s black Labrador is always happy to eat what might dismay a less open-minded eater.
                    - Here are two failure practices for you to try at home. Pick whichever appeals to you more.
                    - Limited resource cooking allows you to practice both divergent and convergent thinking.
                        - How could you make a dessert with just what you have in your kitchen right now? It doesn’t have to be delicious, just edible and dessertlike. Seriously, take the time to think about it. Feel that struggle in your brain? That’s neuroplasticity at work.
                        - Now open your fridge. What main course could you make with only what is in the fridge?
                        - And now, considering everything in your kitchen, could you make pancakes, or something that vaguely resembles pancakes? Let’s say all you have is a few unripe bananas. Here’s what you can do: roast the bananas in the oven until they’re black outside to speed-ripen (this is like turbocharging ripening). Mash the bananas. Heat frying pan, and use the mashed bananas as you would pancake batter. Wait until it’s well caramelized before flipping. Enjoy.
                    - Deliberate failure cooking encourages you to deliberately do something “wrong” to gain possible new insights. For instance, baking cookies at the wrong temperature ended up giving us soft-baked cookies. Eric Maisel gives this exercise: Make an omelet with three eggs, but drop the eggshells into the pan with the eggs. Carefully put the omelet on a plate. Look at it. You’ve made an omelet that is a failure. Or is it? Isn’t it pretty interesting, with a funny pattern of crispy shells sticking out? Bet you’ve never seen an omelet like that before! Didn’t you feel different, slightly taboo, as you dropped your eggshells in the pan, wondering what would happen? Won’t you remember this omelet while you forget all of the boring normal ones you’ve made a hundred times?
                - Improvisational Theater
                    - Improvisational theater, commonly known as “improv,” has been discovered to be an excellent leadership tool in recent years. Young leaders at some of the best business schools take classes on improv to help them become more comfortable with going with the flow, working with what people give them, trusting in the process of collaboration.
                    - The practice of improv is like performing a play while the entire cast is walking on tightropes. There are no lines, stories, or anything even rehearsed. The actors are given a concept or a situation, such as “at a dentist’s office,” and then they start making it up, improvising. It is not easy. You have to take your cues from the other actors, build on what they’re doing, and add your own ideas to the mix, all while trying to tell a coherent, and often funny, story. Failure is inevitable and expected.
                    - Throughout your failure practice, it’s really important to focus on the behavior, not the outcome. Dahlkoetter phrases it this way: “Focus on process goals rather than outcome goals.”
                    - Olympic coach Charlie Brown explains: “Outcome goals or ‘performance goals’ compare you against someone else. They are useful as aspirational goals, but you can’t control whether they happen or not. And you want to focus on what you can control. Performance goals compare you to a preset standard. The problem is that this assumes specific (optimal) conditions, and you don’t control those, either.”
                    - Process goals focus on the things that are under your control, which could be behaviors or mental processes. Just as we’ve told you that we can’t guarantee breakthrough, but we can tell you how to maximize your chances of getting there, process goals help you maximize your chances of success in whatever you are trying to achieve.
                - Mental Practice
                    - Now that you have some tools for experiential practice, let’s talk about mental practice. The effectiveness of mental practice has been extensively studied, and mental practice is now an absolute requirement for world-class athletic training. Every single one of the Olympic coaches we interviewed spent at least half the interview on mental practice, and one of them told us: “I doubt you could find any Olympian who doesn’t incorporate mental practice into his or her training.” In fact, one Olympian even said: “Once you get to a certain level, it’s all in the mind.”
                    - When we say “practice failure,” what we really mean is practice your response to failure. You can’t control the circumstances, you can’t control the outcome, but you can control your response to the outcome. And that means changing the way you view failure, which really means changing the way your brain reacts to failure, changing the failure-response wiring in your brain. Changing your mind is rewiring your mind; every time you change your mind you are literally changing a response wiring in your brain. Hello, neuroplasticity.
                    - Mental practice, which is also called mental rehearsal or visualization, is an elite tool for all high performers, from athletes to musicians to the U.S. Army Special Forces. Mental rehearsal is one of the many ways to rewire one’s brain. Any time you think a thought, you are either creating a new physical connection or strengthening an existing one. By rehearsing a different reaction to failure, you wire and then strengthen the circuits of the new reaction.
                    - Dr. Wes Sime has worked with many Olympic athletes and their coaches. He told us of one dramatic example of the power of mental practice he encountered when he was working with a young acrobatic diver.
                    - Sime told us the story of a diver who hit the board on his way down and hit the water so hard he fractured his cervical vertebrae. Out of physical training for six weeks while his bones mended, the diver practiced mental training. He imagined and went through the perfect dive. It was a relief for the diver to continue to practice without risk of further physical injury.
                    - Using neurofeedback, Wes taught the diver to quiet his mind and achieve total focus on the task, to “stay in the zone,” as athletes often say. Sime told us: “Neurofeedback turbocharges mental training, because it allows you to focus so deeply that the imagery sinks into your mind far deeper.”
                    - After six weeks of mental training, he was in a competition. Sime told us: “Diving is such a precision sport. Usually, in competition, we get five perfect dives, two or three respectable dives, and the rest is a wash. Yet here was this kid, after six weeks out of the water, his first time back after an injury, and every single one of his dives was perfect.”
                    - Here are a few guidelines on how to get the most out of visualization.
                        - Live the moment.
                        - When pole-vaulters practice mental rehearsal, they practice every step of their run, planting the pole, feeling the air rushing about them. Legendary swimmer Michael Phelps has practiced his strokes every single night just before bedtime since he was twelve years old. He would imagine the feel of the water on his skin, the air in his nostrils, the tension of his muscles, and the torsion of his body as he completed his flip turns.
                        - For best results, make sure that your rehearsals are in first person—meaning that rather than seeing yourself from the outside, you see through your own eyes, breathe through your own lungs. Remember to make it as sensory rich as possible.
                        - Focus on behaviors, not (just) outcomes.
                        - We’re sometimes asked: “When is it constructive visualization, and when is it just fantasy daydreaming, mental escapism?”
                        - The difference between the two is somewhat akin to the difference between helpful critique and destructive criticism. They’re both critical, but with very different aims: Helpful critique focuses on the behaviors, the elements that you can change or adapt to, and gives you a sense of progression. Destructive criticism, on the other hand, leaves you feeling defeated and discouraged. In the same way, constructive visualization is focused on a specific behavior that you want to perform at a specific time, rather than just the outcome you’re hoping for.
                        - If, for instance, you’re rehearsing an upcoming presentation, don’t just imagine the congratulations of your peers, the applause of the audience. Instead, focus on how you will feel at each stage of your presentation, how you will move, walk, talk, and breathe.
                        - There are two exceptions, when you actually do want to spend time visualizing the outcome: to help you make yourself believe that the goal is actually possible, and to test how you feel about a possible outcome, to see if that’s really the outcome you want.
                        - Rehearse all possible scenarios.
                        - It is absolutely critical that your mental practice doesn’t just include imagining a win. You also need to imagine every possible thing that could go wrong, and your ideal behavior in that scenario. Dr Dahlkoetter told us: “Too many athletes spend all their time visualizing only the perfect outcome, which rarely happens.” Instead, she has her athletes visualize several action plans in an if-then scenario (“if this happens, I’ll do this”), covering as many contingencies as possible.
                        - Matthew Brady was a U.S. Army Special Ops aviator, a helicopter pilot flying for the Army’s elite Night Stalkers unit in Iraq and Afghanistan. Special Operations forces are the ones who volunteer to step into the most dangerous situations.
                        - Brady explained, “When the Army asks: ‘Who wants to go behind enemy lines? Oh—and we have no idea what’s waiting for you and we probably won’t be able to send support,’ these are the guys who raise their hands.”17
                        - The team members would usually start with table-talk rehearsals—everyone sitting around a table and talking things through. They would “what if” the mission: what might happen, what might go wrong.
                        - Then there were computer-based virtual simulations. Let’s say Brady was going to fly a mission through a valley in Afghanistan. He would send the coordinates of where he was going back to Fort Campbell, and the “sims” teams there would build a computer-simulated virtual terrain and send it back to Matt.
                        - They would load this simulation into the flight simulator, essentially a box sitting on hydraulics containing the exact replica of a helicopter cockpit. The “windows” are screens showing a virtual reconstruction of the terrain in which the mission will take place.
                        - Brady would virtually fly through the simulated valley and land on the same mountain peak half a dozen times in the hours before the actual mission. He would add variables to the mission, such as poor weather conditions. Thanks to these rehearsals, by the time he actually went on a mission, he felt as if he’d already flown the course multiple times. In many cases, he told us, these rehearsals saved his life.
                        - Brady recalled one particular instance, flying into a remote part of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan on a dark, moonless night. The pilots depended entirely on night vision goggles to be able to see anything. The two helicopters were going in to pick up a Special Forces team they had dropped off the night before, and take the team back to base. They were flying down a corridor of mountains, with 12,000-foot peaks on either side of them.
                        - The lead helicopter aimed for the landing while Brady held back. The terrain was so rugged that, as the lead helicopter descended, an outcropping protruding from the side of the mountain pushed the hydraulic actuators in the rear of the helicopter through a fuel line and cut off fuel to the right engine. At 9,000 feet, they couldn’t maintain altitude with just one engine, so with the engine cut they plummeted downwards. It was a huge explosion, and worse yet, the ammunition started going off.
                        - Somehow, miraculously, no one was hurt. But the light from the explosion came barreling down the mountain corridor and blinded Brady and his copilot through their night vision goggles. “A massive fireball, on a zero illumination night, in the middle of a hallway of mountains, wearing night vision goggles, kinda looks like the Apocalypse, only brighter.” Flying blind, Brady had to maintain a holding pattern at 9,000 feet.
                        - “When you want to hold your position in a helicopter, it’s more efficient to fly in a very small circle or a figure-eight pattern than to stay stationary because of the power required to perform a stationary high hover. At our altitude, it was not only more efficient, it was absolutely necessary. Had we tried to hold stationary, we would have dropped like a stone, and there was nowhere to land for about five or six miles.” Altitude makes the air thin and the air pressure low. Helicopters can’t hover in low-pressure air; the back rotor goes out and the helicopter goes into an uncontrollable spin.
                        - Imagine trying to fly a helicopter in a figure-eight pattern, inside a narrow valley, with jagged rock on either side. And now imagine doing all that blindfolded, knowing that if you err even by a few yards, you will slam into the rock, crash, and die.
                        - “So we performed a small figure-eight pattern while sorting through the possible ‘what if’ scenarios. This also allowed our night vision goggles, and our eyes, a chance to recalibrate when facing away from the fireball.” It was only their rehearsal of flying through the terrain that made it possible.
                        - “We didn’t know what had happened. Were they shot down? Was it mechanical failure? Was the team compromised?” One thing they did know was that it was almost daylight, and in daylight you can be seen and shot at. They were running out of time: dawn meant you had to be out of there.
                        - So they flew to an intermediate base about five miles back, landed, and “talked it through” all over again. They learned from intercepted Taliban radio chatter that, because the Army had been firing artillery into the surrounding mountains that night, the helicopter crash was assumed by the enemy to be just another shell.
                        - Since the Taliban didn’t know the team was on the mountaintop, Brady and his copilot decided they could afford to wait and come back the next night. In situations like these, Special Forces joke that the stranded team would just have to sit and roast marshmallows.
                        - Brady flew back to the Bagram Airbase to “reset” his crews and equipment (prepare for the next flight). The next night, they successfully returned and picked up every member of the team. “Because we had flown virtually before, we felt we would be able to solve it. And we did. And it was because we had tried it before.”
                        - Playing out what-ifs, hypothetical scenarios, while your fellow soldiers have just crash-landed and are stranded on a mountaintop in enemy territory might seem a little cold. But Brady explained that’s what helped him stay focused in the midst of overwhelming uncertainty. “We didn’t think of it personally. We thought of it like a puzzle, more clinically. That helped us deal with it.” This is where tools like detaching that we covered earlier can be useful.
                        - While most of us will never fly night missions into the Afghan mountains or have virtual terrains created for us, we also won’t be put in situations that might get us killed. That means we can rehearse by having actual experiences.
                        - Learning
                        - We saw in the previous chapter that to develop his breakthrough vacuum, James Dyson adopted the trial-and-error frame Edison used in his Menlo Park research lab. Dyson would build a prototype, test it, analyze why it failed, make corrections, then build another prototype. This makes complete sense—you know you should learn from your failures. But how? Though each failure (experiment! pivot!) is unique, here are a few guidelines that may be helpful.
                        - Don’t Beat Yourself Up
                        - You learn from a failure when you analyze and critique the decisions, the process, or the behavior—but not the person who made those decisions or engaged in that behavior. As Brené Brown puts it, there is a huge difference between thinking “I’ve done something stupid” and thinking “I am stupid.”
                        - Tina Seelig recommends that the very first thing to do after a failure is to take a circus bow. “After a failure, just like a clown at a circus, throw your arms in the air and announce ‘Ta-daaaa!’ In this manner, you acknowledge the failure but in a positive way.”
                        - Ignore the Outcome (for Now)
                        - “World-class poker players talk about the decisions they made, not the outcomes,” says Annie Duke. These players know to focus on the things they can control, which are the decisions they made, rather than the outcome, which in poker is truly out of their hands.
                        - What Duke means is that you shouldn’t judge how good your decision was based on the outcome of that decision, because you don’t actually control the outcome. In her case, she wants to know whether or not she’d calculated the odds correctly. If, for example, she had correctly assessed that she had a 70 percent chance of winning the pot if she stayed in the game, and ended up losing, she doesn’t take that to mean she was wrong to stay in the game. Instead, she accepts that there was a 30 percent chance that she would lose. The outcome doesn’t invalidate her reasoning. “In poker, it’s never a hundred percent certain,” she explains.
                        - Learn to judge the success or failure not by the outcome, but by the quality of the decisions made. “You should only be as happy or sad as the quality of the experiment you ran,” says Astro Teller, “independent of the outcome. If you ran a smart, thoughtful experiment but got a bad result, you still celebrate.”
                        - “When you lose a hand, hindsight bias makes it very easy to feel you were wrong. And when you get into that space, it can cause you to adjust your play in very bad ways.” Annie told us that often, when you “called” and lost, you actually were right to call, and you have to embrace that you did all you could. “It was a good call whether I won the hand or not.”
                        - Look Around the Failure
                        - Marie Curie discovered radium and polonium in the “imperfections,” the dust surrounding two other elements that she was focusing on. Her Nobel Prize truly emerged from the dust, debris, and unwanted materials around the uranium minerals that she had set out to study.
                        - She also changed the world of physics forever. Up until the late nineteenth century, the atom was still believed to be the smallest indivisible unit of matter. People thought atoms could not break apart. Henri Becquerel was starting to believe this was not true. But it was Marie Curie who blew the lid off the theory. Coming off William Roentgen’s work with X-rays, Curie began working with the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity. Some elements gave off energy. The question was how. Curie was the first one to realize that it was a physical phenomenon, not a chemical one. Atoms were physically falling apart and releasing energy.
                        - Curie conceived of an experiment to prove this and performed the experiment. As a nuclear chemist who works at Curie’s original lab put it: “While many others were battling in the jungle of odd and unexplained phenomena, she was the first to climb to the top of a tall tree, look around, and shout ‘Wrong jungle!’ or rather ‘This is not the jungle in which we thought we had landed!’”
                        - Curie ushered in the age of atomic physics and quantum mechanics.
                        - Get Feedback
                        - Go see people whose opinion you respect: one or a few people in your field, such as mentors or colleagues, and a few outside of your field.
                        - To avoid your feedback source being tainted by hindsight bias, you can use the poker mindset Annie Duke revealed earlier: “When world-class poker players talk to one another for help analyzing a play, you never hear them talk about the outcome. Instead, they lay out situations, all the factors they were aware of, and they ask for feedback on each of their decisions, turn by turn. It’s not until they have gone through the entire chain of events and received feedback on each decision that they reveal the outcome.”
                        - You can do the same thing with the people you ask for feedback. Rather than starting with the outcome, describe the situation as you understood it, the variables, and what decisions you made at each point. Ask them what they would have done. Mention a few of the alternative options you’ve thought up and see what they say. And only when you’ve received feedback on each intermediary step and decision should you tell them how it ended up.
                        - “If you win, it’s not luck, it’s included in the math. And if you lose, it was also included in the math, and you have to accept that, because losing will happen a certain percent of the time.” There will be times, as Annie Duke explained, when you will have made every decision correctly and still lose or fail. That’s the math.
                        - Now that you’re familiar with all the tools needed to handle failure, here’s how they all come together in a blueprint:
                        - Putting It into Practice: The Failure Blueprint
                            - Reframe failure—learn to see it as an essential part of the breakthrough process.
                            - Practice failure:
                                - Experientially: sports, poker, cooking, etc.
                                - Mentally: rehearsals and visualization.
                            - During failure, use self-forgiveness and self-compassion to quiet your fight-or-flight response.
                                - Learn from the failure:
                                - Don’t beat yourself up.
                                - Ignore the outcome (for now).
                                - Deconstruct the process.
                                - Look around the failure.
                                - Go see other people.
                                - Write up your post-mortem.
                            - Knowing that there actually is a “right” way to fail helps talk back to:
                                - The inner critic: “We were following the Failure Blueprint.”
                                - The impostor syndrome: “Maybe we’re an impostor, but we have a blueprint to follow that will help us do things right.”
                                - The perfectionist: “We’re perfectly following the blueprint. It just so happens the blueprint calls for imperfection and failure.”
                                - The maximizer: “This is the way to get the most out of the process.”
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - The internal experience of failure is one of shame, dismay, disappointment, or even despair.
                    - Failure skills ensure you are always in learning mode so you can rebound and keep going.
                    - Reframing helps turn our failures into learning opportunities. There is cognitive reframing, which is rational and logical, and social proof reframing, reminding yourself that lots of people have been in the same situation.
                    - Detaching from the emotions and thoughts around failure helps create perspective.
                    - Learn to handle negative thoughts. Don’t repress them, or they will grow stronger.
                    - We react to failure like we react to grief.
                    - Practice failure both mentally and physically.
                    - Visualization, or mental practice, is a powerful tool in controlling your response to failure.
                    - Learn to judge success and failure not by the outcome but by the quality of the decisions made.
                    - Get and give feedback to others.
            - Chapter 9: Icy Uncertainty
                - Accepting the Unknown
                - HAVE YOU EVER had the awful feeling that you’re just waiting for the other shoe to drop, and finding sometimes that you’d rather have a negative outcome than be left in suspense?
                - Imagine that you’ve landed in a foreign country, halfway around the world. You’re shuffling along in the customs line, feeling tired, grubby, jet-lagged, and very unfamiliar with your surroundings. When the immigration officer waves you up to his counter, you hand over your passport and try to muster as friendly a hello as you can.
                - The immigration officer takes a long look at you, then flips through the pages of your passport. He turns back to the front. He looks at the photo, looks at you, and back again. He reaches for the stamp, but as he does so, he glances at his computer screen and freezes. Then he closes your passport and says, “Wait here, please.” You watch him walk off, your passport in his hand.
                - Now, you know you’re not a terrorist, drug smuggler, or international art thief.* But still—your heart rate increases, adrenaline surges through your veins, and you suddenly feel wide awake and seriously anxious.
                - What happened?
                - Did the immigration officer see something on the screen? Had you been flagged for some reason? Perhaps it’s a mistake, maybe someone with a similar name. You wonder if you’ll be detained for hours.
                - Your mind starts spinning all sorts of scenarios, and as you stand there the anxiety becomes so unbearable that you almost wish the immigration officer would reappear even with bad news, anything but this complete uncertainty.
                - Now imagine that the immigration officer, after looking at your passport, says, “I’m having a problem with my reader. Can you hold on while I go check this with my colleagues? It won’t take more than a minute.” In this case you might tune out, take out your phone, start playing Candy Crush, and wait patiently.
                - The only difference in these two scenarios? The level of uncertainty about what was going on and what was going to happen.
                - We all have different comfort levels when it comes to uncertainty. Each of us has a range, a comfort zone, below which things seem too predictable and life feels boring, and above which things feel unsettling, overwhelming, and confusing. At the extreme of the uncertainty spectrum, you get chaos—total unpredictability.
                - Interestingly, Chaos is the name of the vale from which the Titans, creators of the universe, arose. Does more uncertainty equal more creativity? Yes, in a way. In fact, as we’re about to see, the ability to handle uncertainty is absolutely critical to the breakthrough process.
                - Uncertainty, just like failure, is an unavoidable part of life. In fact, considering the ever-increasing pace of business and technological advances, as well as ever-present unforeseeable economic upheavals, uncertainty will always be a part of our daily lives. As business guru Alan Weiss puts it, “The environment is changing on an hourly basis. This morning’s strategy may not work by lunchtime.”
                - The inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs, such as leading us to make premature decisions. Too often, people feel so uncomfortable being uncertain that they’re willing to do anything to get themselves out of that state. They’ll make a decision before all the elements are in place, or perhaps they’ll kill projects too early because it felt too uncomfortable to let things unfold.
                - In fact, not being able to handle uncertainty is a real breakthrough blocker. The ability to handle uncertainty is particularly important for innovation breakthroughs. Just like with failure, if you’re not willing to do things that have uncertain outcomes, you’ll only do things that have a guarantee of success, which means things that are already known and, by definition, not innovative.
                - The very nature of breakthrough innovation is stepping into uncharted territory: we don’t know where we are, where we’re going, or how we’re going to get there. Innovation requires allowing for a certain degree of uncertainty. In fact, uncertainty is so fundamental to innovation that most companies would see a measurable increase in innovation just by increasing people’s comfort with uncertainty.
                - Discomfort with uncertainty can also catch us in sneakier ways. Sometimes, when you’re experiencing more uncertainty than you’re comfortable with, your verbal processor (often called the “confabulator” by neuroscientists) will construct a story or a reason in order to create a sense of certainty instead.
                - This story becomes a frame through which you see the rest of the experience, which can be limiting: the confabulator tempts us with a feeling of certainty, but its effect is a bit like putting blinders on a horse. You only see a narrow frame.
                - The frustrating thing about a breakthrough? Until it happens, you don’t know how close you are. Until you break through the surface, not one ray of light—and then all of a sudden, illumination. But you have to be willing to stay with the process the whole way through, not knowing how long it will take for the breakthrough to appear.
                - Why Is It So Uncomfortable?
                    - Uncertainty is uncomfortable for most of us. In fact, it is physically uncomfortable for the human brain: it registers in the brain just like pain, activating the amygdala in the same way.
                    - Our natural discomfort with uncertainty is a legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, since it obviously hasn’t killed us yet. The unknown could be dangerous, and we’d better find out if it is. Though you were far from a life-threatening situation when you were left alone in the customs line, the uncertainty your brain experienced felt the same as the kind our ancestors evolved to avoid long ago.
                    - We crave certainty because it gives us the (often illusory) feeling of control. And most of us love control. It makes us feel safe. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is often caused by something outside of our control. In fact, it almost always is unless the uncertainty is caused by indecision.
                    - It’s also particularly hard for us today because we are living in an age of answers. From the moment we start school, we are judged by and valued for how much we know, how many answers we get right. Having an answer provides certainty to a situation. Parents want to be able to answer their children’s questions; teachers want to be able to answer their students’ questions; scientists want to answer the riddles of nature. Nobody wants to stand up in front of others and say “I don’t know.”
                    - But there is an interesting paradox in all of this. Although we get rewarded by society for knowing answers, for playing our role in establishing certainty, it’s actually when people say “I don’t know,” when they step into not knowing and explore from there, that we move forward as a society.
                    - Breakthroughs do not come from people who stand in the certainty of their answers, but from those who have the courage to stand in the uncertainty of their questions.
                    - Those very answers that we use to score well on tests were discovered by people who were willing to stand in a place of not knowing. The breakthroughs that decode the world and give us answers only happen because of the people who are willing to withstand uncertainty without flinching and without blinking. They are willing to stand in uncertainty and ask why. Without that, we’d have no answers at all.
                    - Answers and questions are two sides of the same coin. Our scientists, anthropologists, economists, philosophers, artists, mathematicians, and innovators have created our world of answers by having the heart and courage to live inside the questions.
                    - In the nineteenth century, the British Empire owned half of all the oceangoing vessels in the world. It was an incredibly lucrative position to have in a world where oceans were the primary trade routes; but the British also had to contend with the uncertainties of piracy, war, and the forces of nature. To deal with pirates, they built the world’s largest navy. To deal with lost ships, they became the insurance center of the world.1
                    - The tools we’re going to give you in this chapter serve essentially the same purpose—protection and insurance—on a psychological level. Some tools will help protect you from uncertainty. You’ll learn how to limit uncertainty by “loading your certainty bucket,” and how to reduce uncertainty by thinking like a poker player. You’ll also learn how to practice uncertainty so you can be less affected by it and handle it better as time goes by. Other tools are like insurance. They help you neutralize uncertainty that has reached an overwhelming level and risks creating uncreative mental states.
                    - You know why uncertainty can be uncomfortable and why it’s important to handle it well. Let’s look at a few tools and exercises to help you deal with it, perhaps even embrace it and make it work to your advantage.
                        - Balance Uncertainty
                            - Everyone has an uncertainty threshold, above which their mind goes into the fight-or-flight state. When we don’t know where we are, where we’re going, or how we’re going to get there, our natural reaction is to activate our sympathetic nervous system, with all its unfortunate consequences.
                            - We instinctively seek to remain below this uncertainty threshold. If your uncertainty-handling capabilities are maxed out and you’re already handling all the uncertainty you can, you’ll avoid adding any more uncertainty elsewhere. This might be disastrous if you’re working on a breakthrough, since uncertainty is vital for creativity. That’s why it’s worth decreasing the uncertainty in areas where it’s not necessary.
                            - Imagine a scale with certainty in one bucket and uncertainty in the other. If you want to be able to handle a heavier uncertainty load, you need to equally load the certainty bucket to keep things in balance. What can you load it with?
                        - Returning to Old Favorites
                            - There is a special kind of agony in the process of writing a book. Few of us have ever made a substantial creative work that didn’t have a series of difficult stages. Feelings of being lost, disoriented, overwhelmed, and afraid of the consequences are par for the course, and, paradoxically, often the sign that one is getting into interesting territory.
                            - One author we know finds herself instinctively turning to well-known and well-loved books during her writing periods. What she is seeking in them is the certainty of an enjoyable experience; there is no uncertainty about what the experience of reading them will be like. The familiarity of the phrases themselves has a comforting effect.
                            - During the writing of her most recent book, she read Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice eight times, cover-to-cover. “There was a reassurance, grounding, and a comfort in reading the familiar phrases—every word perfect, every sentence a delight,” she says.
                - Loading the Certainty Bucket
                    - Gustave Flaubert’s maxim was “Be regular and orderly in your life . . . so that you may be violent and original in your work.”2 This sentiment is echoed by a number of creatives; you would be surprised at how many well-known artists, novelists, or designers use strict routines, rituals, and schedules in all noncreative areas of their life.
                    - Mason Currey, the aforementioned analyzer of the habits of nearly two hundred of the world’s most prolific inventors and innovators over the ages, wrote: “A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods.”3
                    - Many of the people Currey studied had established a standardized day from the moment they opened their eyes to the moment they went to sleep, seven days a week. Legendary choreographer Twyla Tharp, who has broken every ballet choreography rule in the book, wakes up at the same time, has the exact same breakfast, does the same gym workout, and so forth, through every single moment of her day until she heads to bed. Immanuel Kant went on daily walks that were so exact that people said you could set your watch to them.
                    - Having so much predictability in 90 percent of their days allows people like Tharp to be wildly creative, going boldly into the uncertainty, in the 10 percent of their day when this creativity is key. If you want to handle uncertainty in breakthrough areas, you must minimize uncertainty everywhere else. By confining uncertainty to the areas where it is most useful, you can maintain a consistent performance in all areas of your life.
                    - This is where routines and rituals* come in. These are some of the most effective tools you can use. They add predictability and reliability to your life. They are grounding experiences you can count on, no matter what’s going on. Their consistency is what makes them effective: they provide a kind of psychological bedrock, a way to load the certainty bucket and provide a counterweight to uncertainty.
                    - Human habits have been under much scrutiny lately, and the science of habit formation is fascinating. You’ll find several excellent books on the topic in the resources section of this book. B. J. Fogg, head of the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, creator of the Tiny Habits method, considers habit making a fundamental skill and one that should be taught in school, “especially in the age of scattered distraction we live in.”
                    - In addition, “Habits can permanently raise people’s happiness baseline,” happiness researcher Shawn Achor tell us. Even if you think you have no discipline at all, you have more than you think. Everyone has some routines that are good for them, such as brushing your teeth.
                - The Science of Habit Formation
                    - If there’s one thing we can learn from Mason Currey’s research, it’s that there really is no single ritual, routine, or habit that will lead to generating breakthroughs. The only two common threads are:
                    - Chemicals: Alcohol, of course, but also every kind of drug one could possibly imagine. Olivia was shocked to discover how many world-famous mathematicians and scientists used amphetamines daily. (“Poets, yes, writers, artists, perhaps; but not scientists, not physicists, they’re supposed to be respectable people!”) Judah has spent enough time at Burning Man to have seen everyone, from priests to politicians, under a variety of influences.
                    - Daily walks: walking every day is a great ritual and serves a dual purpose, loading the certainty bucket and giving you a good way to access your breakthrough experience.
                    - Yes, ideally you’d want all your rituals to serve this dual purpose. But don’t get caught in the trap of thinking that all of them must do so: that’s your maximizer talking. Don’t go chasing after “the best” rituals. If you do something, that’s enough to make it worth it.
                    - Ideally, your rituals would allow you some change of pace from the rest of your tasks. Performance researcher and author Tony Schwartz has found that our brains become easily fatigued: they need breaks to be able to refocus, create, and produce.
                    - “When we don’t give them the needed time to refuel,” he told us, “they more or less start to shut down and ratchet up the crankiness until we have to listen. By then, we’ve often spent hours at work without really accomplishing a whole lot of actual work. When you don’t give your brain a chance to refuel, you lose creativity, cognitive function, productivity, and you put yourself at risk of fear and anxiety.”4
                    - Aim to have your rituals give you a break from what you were doing. Your brain needs downtime; it can’t stay at peak performance mode or any other steady state throughout the day. It needs to alternate from high-performance mode to low-performance mode, like a shark that needs to keep swimming to stay alive.
                    - Even just thirty seconds of any ritual to clear your head—whatever works for you—can allow your brain to ramp down and thus get the oscillation it needs to avoid a crash. And yes, we understand how busy your days are, but don’t tell us you can’t take just thirty seconds at regular intervals throughout the day.
                    - Here are some tips to help you form workable routines, rituals, and habits.
                - Start Small
                    - Every single expert we interviewed about rituals was adamant about the importance of starting small. Fogg’s Tiny Habits method teaches people habit formation by setting tiny goals to increase the likelihood of success.5 Not only does this give you the “small wins” that add up to a real sense of confidence in your momentum, it also satisfies the basic human need for completion we no longer get from our 24/7 jobs.
                    - Olympic coach Charlie Brown says that more than anything else, our confidence is based on whether or not we have achieved our goals. So set smart goals: small goals you know you can achieve and that will build your confidence.
                    - Make your new habit easy. In fact, make it so easy it seems laughable. If your aim is to floss regularly, for example, Fogg recommends you start with the goal of flossing just one tooth. When you get to that stage, that’s when you know you’ve made it easy enough. One of our clients, after a decade of meditation practice, decided to take a few months off. As with any other training or fitness program, it was all too easy to let things slip, and soon these few months became a year, then two.
                    - She assumed she should immediately return to her previous level of practice: a full forty-five minutes of meditation every day. Somehow, there was always an “excellent reason” to delay until the next day. She finally, begrudgingly, realized that she’d have to start small. Really small. She began with just two minutes. “It’s really hard to argue that you can’t take two minutes in a whole day. From there, it was easier to tack on another minute—‘Just another sixty seconds’—then five minutes, then ten, and so forth.”
                    - When Shawn started his research to determine which habits were most conducive to creating happiness, he ended up with an Excel spreadsheet fifteen habits long. “By day two, I was feeling overwhelmed, it was 2 P.M. and I hadn’t gotten anything done other than those happiness things. By day three, I’d totally given up.” Nowadays, he recommends choosing only one new habit at a time.
                        - Get Specific
                        - Translate target goals into specific behaviors. For instance, if you’re aiming to exercise more, translate it into the necessary behaviors: go running every morning, get a trampoline, and so forth. “Rituals,” Tony Schwartz told us, “need precision to be effective: be very specific about the time, place, and any other specific you can determine for the behavior you want to adopt.”
                        - Find a Trigger
                        - What will prompt the behavior? Some behaviors are natural (waking up). Others you must design or determine (answering the phone). For our client, the right trigger turned out to be having her meditation space set up in such a way that she had to pass over it to get to her closet: it was impossible not to see it.
                        - Set Incentives
                        - Tim Ferriss, author of the wildly successful The 4-Hour Workweek, told us that “When seeking to create new habits, new rituals, or achieving new goals, people focus far too much on the mechanics when they should, instead, focus on the incentives. Figure out the why, and the how will take care of itself.” As he explained it, the mechanics are very attractive because they seem like variables that can be endlessly tested with little effort.
                        - For reinforcement, our meditating client used gold stars, but with a loss-aversion twist: she would give herself the gold star before she started the meditation, and if she didn’t finish it, she had to take the gold star away.
                        - Plan for Failure
                        - Yes, really. Kelly McGonigal’s research showed that predicting how and when you might be tempted to break your vow increases the chances that you will keep a resolution. When are you most likely to be tempted and give in? What is most likely to distract you from your focus? What justifications will your brain use to convince you to skip the new habit “just this once”? Imagine yourself in that situation, what it will feel like, and what you will be thinking. Look at how a typical willpower failure unfolds. Consider what specific actions would help. Then visualize success.
                        - “Your rational self sets a course for you to follow, but often the tempted self decides to change course at the last minute when presented with the temptation,” says McGonigal. “The result will ultimately be self-sabotage.” In The Willpower Instinct, she quotes behavioral economist George Ainslie on this point: “Take steps to predict and constrain that self as if it were another person.”6 Study your tempted self; see what choices it makes and organize things so you have the best chance of success.
                        - Don’t Rely on Willpower
                        - McGonigal describes willpower, which is also called self-control, as a muscle. When used, the muscle tires, and if you don’t rest it, you can run yourself into exhaustion. In fact, exerting willpower physically fatigues us.7 It is a finite resource, so be strategic about where and when you expend it.
                    - What is absolutely critical to understand is that every single act of self-control depletes willpower, whether you’re trying to stay calm, refuse a cookie, or sit through a boring meeting. Anytime you have to fight an impulse, filter out distractions, or make yourself do something difficult, you use a little more of your willpower. This includes even trivial things, such as choosing between twenty brands of laundry detergent. Whenever you have a decision to make, you’re using up your willpower reserves.
                    - When our willpower tank hits empty, we revert to the path of least resistance, or the default setting: that is, the way things are unless you expend energy to change them.8
                    - A fantastic study from Eric Johnson and Daniel Goldstein of Columbia University’s Center for Decision Sciences, published in the prestigious journal Science in 2003, revealed a striking difference among European countries with regard to the rates of organ donation consent.9 The contrast was especially drastic between Germany (12 percent consent) and Austria (99.98 percent consent) or between Denmark (4.25 percent) and Sweden (85.9 percent).
                    - Why would countries with very similar social and healthcare policies in other respects be so drastically divergent on this one issue? Because of one simple, small difference. In Sweden, you are presumed to agree to organ donation unless you check the box to opt out. In Denmark, you have to opt in: by default, you are presumed not to have consented to organ donation unless you take action to consent.
                    - You’d think people would care pretty strongly about whether or not their organs will be removed from their body, but they don’t. At least, not enough to express a preference. In the vast majority of cases, people let the default setting stand.
                    - What you want to do is make it easy to go into the new behavior, and in fact, to make it so easy that it becomes the default. The classic example is putting your workout shoes and gym bag near the door.
                    - Better yet, make it hard not to do it. If it’s more effort not to do the behavior you hope will become a habit, that’s ideal. Make the old behavior harder to do than the new one: one author dismantled his laptop to prevent his tempted self from surfing the Internet to procrastinate. Another removed the computer’s wireless card and destroyed its Ethernet port.
                    - You’ll have a much greater chance of success if you assume, when you’re envisioning the new behavior, that the person in this situation is the most tired, grumpy, exhausted, hungry, sleepy version of yourself. Better yet, imagine a grumpy, tired kid. Stop trying to speak to the adult in you; the adult (cortex/neocortex) is fully on board. Instead, focus on the less rational, more primal brain parts, which are the ones that will resist the change.
                    - Tim Ferriss says he has succeeded, and continues to succeed, despite himself rather than because of himself. Known for his extreme accomplishments in matters both physical (muscle mass, martial arts, tango) and psychological (speed-reading, language learning), Ferriss explains that most of his readers and viewers have a preconception of him as having a will of iron and the self-discipline of a monk. In fact, he says, “I enjoy frittering my time away as much as the next person. Self-discipline and willpower are very overrated.”
                - Reduce Uncertainty: Think Like a Poker Player
                    - For Annie Duke, the key attribute that separates the best poker players from the rest of the pack is that they embrace uncertainty. You can reduce uncertainty, she explains, but once you have the percent range, you know you’ll only be right a certain amount of time. “It’s about how tight can you get that range, and then accepting the fact that you can never know for sure.”
                    - Whether or not you realize it, you’re always living in probability ranges. When professional poker players talk to one another, you’ll often hear how that permeates the rest of their life.
                    - When Duke’s brother and brother-in-law (both professional poker players) heard that she was going out on a date, they discussed the odds of whether or not she and her date would get married: “I think it’s two to one they’re going to get married,” said her brother-in-law.*
                    - “We do this with anything,” Duke reveals. “What’s the probability a table frees up in the next five minutes? What’s the probability she’s just a waitress? When you’re a poker player, you’re always thinking probabilistically.”
                    - Almost everything in Duke’s life is expressed that way; it’s just the way she thinks. When she buys a Christmas present, such as the coat she recently bought for her boyfriend, she includes the possibility that he might not like it. If that’s the case, she wouldn’t feel hurt, because she knows it was fifty-fifty. She was playing the odds, “setting a market” on the coat.
                    - We strongly encourage you to read any of Annie’s books, which you’ll find in the resources section of this book, and to take her course. Executives who have to make decisions in uncertain conditions would greatly benefit from it.
                    - Practice Uncertainty
                    - Author Chris Germer explains that most people have a very low tolerance for distress. The moment they begin to feel uncomfortable, they look for anything to get rid of that feeling, quick! They try to find ways to soothe or distract themselves, some helpful and healthy, some not.
                    - At other times, they instinctively go to battle against unpleasant emotions and try to suppress them, which unfortunately only makes matters worse. As we’ve seen, suppress grief, and chronic depression may develop. Struggling to fall asleep can keep you awake all night long. Waging a war against our internal feelings is completely counterproductive. There’s great value in considering discomfort as a normal, unavoidable part of life. Everyone, no matter who they are, no matter what they do, will experience it. Often.
                    - Accepting anxiety actually decreases anxiety, even in people with chronic anxiety disorders. Paradoxically, people with generalized anxiety disorder are freed from many of the limitations they’d been living with by accepting these limitations and the chronic anxiety rather than fighting against them.10
                    - Meditation teacher Kenneth Folk recommends naming whatever emotion you are experiencing, then adding “. . . and it’s okay.” For instance, you would say, “I’m feeling really anxious right now, and it’s okay.” Try it—out loud, if at all possible. It really works. Tara Brach offers a variant on this theme, adding “. . . and my life is very blessed.” As we’ve seen in the gratitude section, your life really is very blessed, and you can start a nice oxytocin brain wash by focusing on your innumerable blessings.
                    - Just as we practiced failure, we can practice small steps of uncertainty day by day. You can build tiny uncertainty into your day, every day, by simply doing one thing different. This could be as simple as taking a different route to work, reading a different newspaper, putting on the other sock first.
                    - Neuroscientist Marie Pasinski advocates that people “indulge in the new” by making small changes in their daily routine as a way to stimulate their brain and ultimately expand their intellectual horizons. “It’s amazing to me how new experiences have a way of snowballing,” Pasinski told us. “You stop at a new venue to buy your morning coffee and notice a flyer for a gallery opening. You go to the opening and run into an old friend who then invites you to join her book club. Never underestimate the power of a single action.”11
                        - Go to the Movies
                        - Choose a mystery or thriller and make it a good one: check the reviews and blogs, or be old-fashioned and get a recommendation from a trusted friend. Ideally, come at it “blind”—know as little as possible what it’s about. Watch the movie, but before the mystery is revealed, turn it off.
                        - And now, just be still. Sit with whatever emotions, feelings, and sensations arise. You don’t know what’s going to happen. Do you feel unsettled, as if you had an itch you can’t scratch? Do you have a desire to move, to eat, to drink, to talk to someone? How is your mind reacting? Are you playing out the possibilities in your head? Notice how your body is responding to the uncertainty. Where are most of the sensations located? What kind are they? Pressure, tightness, constriction, tingling?
                        - It’s really difficult to simply stay with whatever discomfort or difficulty you’re experiencing at the moment. Sometimes it’s the hardest and most courageous thing you can do, to just be with the feelings, thoughts, and sensations, and let the moment roll in. There is such a strong urge to run away from the experience of internal discomfort. Meditators sometimes joke, when speaking of difficult emotions, “Don’t just do something, sit there!”
                        - Or, as Franz Kafka put it: “You need not leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary.”12 This is wonderful advice. Kafka, however, goes on to assure us: “The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.” We wish.
                        - Throughout this exercise, notice that none of your reactions have any effect on the outcome.
                        - Go to a Game
                        - You can also experience uncertainty, and get comfortable with it, while watching sports. Uncertainty is a big part of why sports are so enthralling to us when we watch them in real time: we don’t know the outcome. Here, the uncertainty is exciting, and this is a great illustration of how uncertainty isn’t always correlated with anxiety. Rather than being tied to anxious apprehension, it can be tied to eager anticipation.
                        - If you’ve ever heard someone say “the suspense is killing me,” that’s because, as we’ve seen, uncertainty registers in the brain as pain. Even when it’s in an overall pleasurable situation, we phrase it as something that hurts. Watching sports is a great way to experience uncertainty in a safe environment and to get comfortable with that sensation.
                        - Choose any sport you like. Ideally, pick a game in which a playoff spot or championship is on the line, as that will heighten the experience. As the game or match progresses, delve into the sensations you are experiencing. Notice how the uncertainty feels in your body.
                        - Notice how you feel when your team is winning as opposed to when your team is losing. How do the physical sensations change? How do your behaviors change? Do you get up and walk around a lot? Do you wish the game would be over already so you would just know and this discomfort in your body could settle? Do you find yourself parsing the tiniest detail about the players to try to gain insight into what will happen? Has the suspense, the uncertainty, grabbed your entire attention? The desire to settle uncertainty can do that.
                        - And when the game is over, how do you feel? Elated your team won? Sad that they lost? Either way, pay attention to how it feels to have the uncertainty settled at last.
                        - The purpose of these exercises is to help you detach from the sensations of uncertainty, to view them objectively, just as you would any other physical sensation, like hot or cold. This helps loosen the hold uncertainty has on you. Knowing the feelings, physical sensations, and behaviors you tend toward when coping with uncertainty can also alert you and help prevent a premature action. Sometimes, we don’t realize that we’re having trouble with uncertainty, and we’ll take action before we realize that the decision is motivated not by rational considerations but by an unconscious desire to make the uncertainty end.
                - Neutralize Uncertainty: The Responsibility Transfer
                    - The flip side of fear of uncertainty is the need for certainty. Imagine you’re dealing with a difficult situation whose outcome is uncertain. You envision a variety of ways it could play out, and you strategize how to best deal with each. So far, so good. Once you’ve thought through each scenario, the rational, reasonable, logical thing to do would be to put the situation out of your mind and go about your day until action is actually required.
                    - But how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we’ve made, replaying the possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations, not once or twice, but ad nauseam? And all this because we’re unable to rest comfortably in the uncertainty. At what point do we declare this rehashing irrational?
                    - How can we make the uncertainty less daunting, more comfortable? At heart, most compulsive habits, whether of thought or of behavior, are a way for people to feel safe and reassured, to feel they’ve done all they can to stave off the potential for failure.
                    - When we’re worried about an uncertain situation, what we’re really worried about is whether things will work out all right. If we could instill in ourselves the belief that everything will work out well, for certain, we’d be much more comfortable with not knowing exactly how that’ll happen.
                    - One psychological tool Olivia developed over the years is called the responsibility transfer. It helps people get more comfortable with uncertainty and let go of their need for certainty, or rather find the certainty they need in more helpful ways. We give a modified version of this tool to all our clients, and many of them, from seasoned CEOs to starting students, report how effective it is.
                    - Putting It into Practice: The Responsibility Transfer
                        - Sit comfortably or lie down, relax, and close your eyes.
                        - Take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing clean air toward the top of your head. As you exhale, let that air whoosh through you, washing away all worries and concerns.
                        - Pick an entity—God, Fate, the universe, whatever may best suit your beliefs—you can think of as benevolent.
                        - Imagine lifting the weight of everything you’re concerned about—this meeting, this interaction, this day—off your shoulders and placing it on the shoulders of the entity you’ve chosen. They’re in charge now.
                        - Visually lift it off your shoulders and feel the difference as you are now no longer responsible for the outcome of any of these things. Everything is taken care of. You can sit back, relax, and enjoy whatever good you can find along the way.
                    - After doing the responsibility transfer, many clients report feeling lighter, or as if their chests opened up and expanded. If you don’t feel any physical reaction or mental relief when you try this exercise, it may simply mean that uncertainty is not creating anxiety for you. If you do feel something happen, fantastic—you’ve performed a responsibility transfer.
                    - The next time you feel yourself considering alternative outcomes to a situation, pay close attention. If your brain is going around in circles, obsessing about possible outcomes, try a responsibility transfer to alleviate some of the anxiety. Consider that there might be an all-powerful entity—the universe, God, Fate—and entrust it with all the worries on your mind.
                    - Over time, many of our clients have found themselves returning to this technique so often that it becomes instinctive. With each practice, it becomes easier to visualize, to transfer their everyday worries and cares, and to enjoy the physiological effects of the transfer.
                    - The reason this technique works is that, as you now know, when presented with a scenario, our brain’s first reaction is to consider it as possible. William Bosl, former research scientist at the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, explains the implications of a recent fMRI study on belief, disbelief, and uncertainty as follows.13
                    - “Our brains are wired first to understand, then to believe, and last to disbelieve. Since disbelief requires additional cognitive effort, we get the physiological effects first. And, though this belief may last only a brief moment, it’s enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance, which can change our thought patterns as well as help alleviate the uncomfortable feelings.”14
                    - In other words, visuals bypass our slower cognitive circuits and go straight to our brain’s emotional centers, and our physiology responds well before cognitive disbelief kicks in. By then, we’ve already gotten the beneficial brain wash.
                    - Uncertainty is not actually dispelled by the responsibility transfer; the outcome remains uncertain. Instead, it makes the uncertainty less uncomfortable. This distinction matters. People will go to great lengths to get rid of the anxiety produced by uncertainty, which can lead them to make premature decisions, to force bad outcomes, or to numb their anxiety with state-altering substances of various kinds.
                    - The responsibility transfer, on the other hand, works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing. So though the outcome of your situation may still be uncertain, you will no longer feel so anxious about it.
                    - By presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you’re putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect—the brain’s inability to distinguish between imagination and reality. The placebo effect works even when we know we’re self-deceiving, perhaps thanks to this natural cognitive delay in disbelief. A study conducted by the Harvard Medical School suggests that deception may not be necessary for the placebo effect to take hold; it may work its wonders even when people know full well that they’re taking a placebo.15
                - KEY TAKEAWAYS
                    - Uncertainty is uncomfortable, but it’s a necessary step in achieving maximal creativity and reaching breakthroughs. Avoiding uncertainty may reduce short-term anxiety, but it limits our potential, leading to premature decisions and missed opportunities.
                    - Uncertainty can be balanced with healthy habits, rituals, and routines in other areas of our life.
                    - When working to form a new, positive habit, start small. Define the target habit or routine specifically and find a trigger to spur consistency. Create incentives for yourself, but anticipate that some level of failure will accompany the process.
                    - Willpower isn’t enough. When it comes to new habits, willpower is a finite (and easily depleted) resource. We cannot rely on it alone to achieve our new desired behavior. Create defaults to make your new routine easy.
                    - Practice uncertainty. There are ways to do this, including playing games like poker, naming and accepting the uncertainty verbally, or experiencing uncertainty in safe situations like at a movie or a sporting event.
                    - Use the responsibility transfer exercise to lessen the anxiety of uncertainty. Uncertainty will remain, but the discomfort will be reduced or even eliminated. Repeat the exercise as needed.
            - Chapter 10: The SuperTools
                - ORLÉANS, 1429. THE city has been under siege for five long months. The French army, still reeling from their crushing defeat at Agincourt, is demoralized, defeated, and by their own account, have lost all sense of initiative. England and France have been at war for ninety-two years. And Orléans is of such strategic importance that if it falls, the English regent is likely to succeed in conquering all of France. Things are bad—really bad. And that is when a sixteen-year-old illiterate peasant girl named Joan changed the course of history.
                - Young Joan of Arc was burning with such a strong sense of purpose to “kick the English out of France” that she left her father’s farm in the small village of Domrémy and made her way through embattled territories to the French court of Chinon, where she gained an audience with the young French prince and convinced him to send her at the head of a mission to break the English siege of Orléans.
                - In the five months before Joan’s arrival, the demoralized French army had only made a single attempt to free Orléans. With Joan carrying their banner into battle, they mounted three offensives in five days, and freed the city in nine. It was the first significant French success in fourteen years.
                - It is impossible to overstate just how extraordinary Joan’s achievement was. In medieval Europe, for an unmarried peasant girl to reach the French court would already be remarkable. For her to gain an audience with the prince was astounding. But for her to convince the future king of France to send her at the head of his army is simply extraordinary.
                - Similarly, we cannot overstate the importance of a sense of purpose on the road to breakthroughs. Knowing that you are working for a higher purpose can be a source of strength when taking risks, trying again after a failure, or quieting the voices inside that are telling you to give up.
                - A sense of higher purpose is the first of three SuperTools we gathered in this chapter. There are some tools that are more like practices than tools that you can pull out at a moment’s notice. Their effects are cumulative and more powerful over time. We’ve chosen to call these SuperTools because they not only activate your brain’s genius mode, but also break down creativity blockers on a consistent basis.
                - SuperTool [1](1.md): A Sense of Higher Purpose
                    - Now, you can have a sense of purpose that’s not altruistic. A young sales associate who feels that his purpose in life is to climb the ladder to CEO no matter what it takes does have a purpose. It’s just not one that will give him the breakthrough power that an altruistic purpose would have.
                    - All great innovators we spoke to had a sense that their work was going to help all of humanity. They all seemed to share not only an immense curiosity but also a desire to make things better for everyone.
                    - Alfred Nobel’s brother was killed at one of the family’s factories in an explosion involving nitroglycerin, a highly unstable compound. Nobel became determined to find a way to stabilize the substance. He did, and called it dynamite. And thus the Nobel Prize’s founding father followed his own higher purpose all the way to breakthrough innovation.1
                    - Purpose tends to be externally focused. It is something that we do in the world, to create a change, to help others, to make an impact. Purpose also tends to come with a goal. Gandhi wanted to free India from British rule. Joan of Arc wanted to free France, also from British rule. Jonas Salk, and many others, wanted to save children from the scourge of polio. This was purpose—a drive to take action to achieve a goal.
                    - The sense of purpose created Silicon Valley. The men, and at the time only some women, inventing new technologies were often working for companies developing systems with the U.S. government.2 They were trying to win the Cold War. In other words, there was a deep purpose to their work. Many of them had a core belief that what they were doing was necessary and right. This emotional grounding in purpose is often found where breakthrough innovation flourishes.
                    - When you feel you’re on a mission, working for a higher purpose, that this is your calling—what you’ve been born to do—then every one of your faculties will go on hyperspeed. You’re lit with an inner fire, your brain is firing on all cylinders. This is why Steve Jobs cast himself as a prophet, and why charismatic leaders inspire measurably more breakthrough innovation.
                    - Purpose Turns Your Work into a Mission
                    - Feel the difference between “doing a project” and “being on a mission.” Could Joan of Arc have inspired an army if she saw it as a “project”? The sense that you’re on an important mission can help you do extraordinary things. Joan’s burning sense of purpose spread like an emotional wave throughout the entire French army. They went from feeling like demoralized losers to feeling divinely inspired. Joan’s sense of higher purpose turned a political war into a holy crusade.
                    - Now, it doesn’t have to be “your life’s one true purpose.” We’re not asking you to be Joan of Arc. We’re just saying that if you feel you’re working toward a higher purpose, you’ll have far more breakthroughs.
                    - “I’m not a risk-taker by nature,” says Meg Lowman, chief of science at the legendary California Academy of Sciences.3 In fact, Meg was so shy that she used to throw up before presentations. But she had a passion for the undiscovered tree canopy of the Amazon jungle. And if she wanted to live that passion, she had to take risks. It was the only way.
                    - The first risks were social—going into what was at that time strictly a man’s world. Then the risks were physical—the safety equipment simply didn’t exist at that time, and wouldn’t for quite some time. Meg’s passion for the canopy led her to sew herself a slingshot and design her own walkway. “I was bumping into physical constraints,” she explains. “There were no tools. I was forced to invent.”
                    - Circumstances compelled her into self-reliance. So she took the risk and survived, and with each risk she survived, she became a bit more confident, and it became a bit easier to take the next risk.
                    - A sense of purpose has many other benefits when it comes to breakthrough thinking, strengthening our resolve as we face down a number of daunting challenges. For instance, it makes you more resilient, more focused, and better able to handle stress and make decisions. It is a foundation to happiness—you’ll probably even live longer. For instance:
                        - A sense of purpose helps navigate uncertainty. It gives you something solid to cling to even when all else seems uncertain. Though you may not know where you are in the process, or what’s going to happen, you know what you’re aiming for.
                        - A sense of purpose increases self-confidence. It also decreases the impostor syndrome and helps silence the inner critic. In fact, it’s the single most effective tool we know after destigmatization. We often ask clients who are feeling nervous about giving a speech, What if you had the cure for cancer? What if it were your God-given mission to bring this message to the world? Would you still feel nervous?
                        - A sense of purpose makes you healthier. Having a strong sense of purpose in life may lower the likelihood of brain tissue damage in older adults, new research suggests. When annual psychological evaluations were stacked up against autopsy results, the research team determined that men and women characterized as having a strong sense of life purpose were 44 percent less likely to have suffered major brain tissue damage. “Having a sense of purpose,” concluded one of the study coauthors, “will make a difference to your physical health.”4
                    - Purpose-Finding Questions
                        - We’ll cover several purpose-uncovering exercises, from quick questions to intense visualization. Though none of these are guaranteed to show you a purpose, they are all useful in helping you find the direction.
                        - Make sure you’re in a quiet spot where you can think uninterruptedly for a few minutes. Read the questions one by one, and take a break after each question to let your mind wander.
                            - What would you like to see written on your tombstone?
                            - When your life is over, how would you like the world to be different because you have lived?
                            - Think of everything you are blessed with, every advantage you have—whether material or immaterial, whether money, time, knowledge, skills, or character traits. These gifts that have been given to you—how have you used them in the service of others?
                        - Putting It into Practice: Finding a Purpose at Your 100th Birthday Gathering
                            - Sit or lie down, close your eyes, and set the scene. Where is your gathering being held? What day of the week, what time of day? What is the weather like? See the building where the gathering is being held. See people arriving. Who’s coming? What are they wearing? Now move into the building and look around inside. Do you see flowers? If so, smell the flowers’ scent heavy in the air. See people coming through the door, perhaps getting drinks at the bar or food at the buffet. Imagine, perhaps, that everyone is sitting around round tables filling the room. What kind of chairs are they sitting in? What do these chairs feel like?
                            - Someone taps on a glass to request attention, and announces that the toasts will begin. Think of the people you care most about or whose opinions matter most to you. What are they thinking? See them standing up one after another and delivering their message for you or their stories about you. What are they saying? Do they mention accomplishments? Regrets?
                            - Now think: What would you like them to have said? What accomplishments would you have liked them to mention, if any? What regrets do you have?
                - SuperTool [2](2.md): Altruism
                    - Imagine you’re in the middle of a really bad day. You had a big presentation but because of technical issues you couldn’t get your slides up on the screen. You might have had time to fix the problem but you showed up late because your daughter woke up sick and threw up on you. Changing your clothes and waiting for your mother to get to the house to take care of your daughter left you no time. You made it through your presentation as best you could, then got back to your desk to find your project lead and design lead in a shouting match. After separating them you decide to call it a day.
                    - You’re in the elevator feeling sorry for yourself when it stops on the fifth floor. You’re annoyed because you thought you were going to make it to the lobby without a stop and you really don’t want to see anyone. A young woman makes her way into the elevator balancing six boxes in her arms. She tries to hit the button for parking level 2 when two of the boxes fall to the floor.
                    - At first you’re just annoyed. Then you grudgingly say, “I got it.” You press the button she missed and then pick the two boxes up off the floor. The young woman smiles and says, “Thank you so much.” Her thanks feels good. It’s the first good thing to happen all day. So you offer to take a third box from her and help her to her car. The young woman, smile widens and she tells you how much she appreciates that. That people in this building tend to be a little cold to one another and that your kindness is refreshing and so helpful. As you help her to her car, the bad things in your day start to lighten.
                    - On the way she tells you that she doesn’t like her job, they don’t pay well at all, and there’s no one in the office near as nice as you are. As you place the last box in her trunk she thanks you for making her day.
                    - Imagine a tool that can:
                        - Help you handle fear, the impostor syndrome, and the inner critic
                        - Help you handle failure and make you more resilient to failure
                        - Help you handle and navigate uncertainty
                        - Boost your breakthrough council and increase creativity
                        - Give your brain a great chemical wash
                    - And as a bonus . . .
                        - Make you happier and healthier
                        - Increase your feelings of connectedness
                        - Decrease your feelings of isolation and the risk of depression
                        - And even make you more persuasive, more charismatic, more attractive, and give you more satisfaction in life
                    - Welcome to the wonders of altruism. Sounds a bit far-fetched? We thought so too. While we were researching and writing this book, altruism kept coming up again and again. We were rather uncomfortable writing about altruism as one of the most powerful tools in a business book, and we have to admit that we even tried to find ways around it. Unfortunately, the evidence was overwhelming and backed by solid science. In fact, it showed up so often we finally decided to gather it all in one place.
                    - Altruism, like a sense of purpose, truly is a SuperTool when it comes to fostering breakthrough innovation. If engaged in consistently, it provides insurance and protection against a number of major creativity blockers. For instance:
                        - Altruism provides a wonderful counterbalance to feelings of failure, impostor syndrome, and the inner critic (“At least I’m doing good”). Helping others tends to boost your own self-worth. It also helps foster self-compassion, makes it easier to forgive yourself (you know your intentions were the best, you were really trying), and brings up common humanity (a key part of self-compassion).
                        - Altruism helps you navigate uncertainty, first by providing some certainty (“At least I know for sure I’m working for the greater good”), and second by giving your brain a great oxytocin wash.
                        - Altruism gets you out of your own head (where most of the tailspins are happening) and more focused on the outside world. With this broader focus, you’re more inclined to take the perspective of others, and that alone increases divergent thinking, the biggest measure of creativity.
                    - Adam Grant told us that “the necessity of others is the mother of invention.”5 His research discovered that when people are in an altruistic mood, they naturally become more creative, and produce ideas and products that are judged to be more novel and useful by experts.
                    - “Prosocial behavior,” he told us, “makes you more open to others’ ideas, more willing to help, more driven to make the world better, less focused on taking credit. It makes it easy for many voices to be heard in the room. It makes it easy for people to share their ideas.”
                    - Altruism increases creativity in many ways. First, by creating positive emotions, it gives your brain the chemical wash that cleans away bad things like stress and anxiety, replacing them with helpful neurochemicals that enable broader focus, divergent thinking, willingness to take risks, and all the other components of creativity and innovation breakthroughs.
                    - And if that weren’t enough . . .
                        - Altruism makes you healthier. “Altruism is good for our immune system,” our science adviser Jon Lieff explained.
                        - Altruism makes you happier. In fact, altruism is “the biggest bang for your buck in terms of happiness,” as Adam Grant puts it. It’s also an equally powerful element of mental hygiene.
                        - Altruism makes you more persuasive and charismatic. How? It increases confidence. Knowing you’re doing good gives you a feeling of efficacy, and that increases the power quotient of your level of charisma. Of course, it also increases your level of warmth. Can’t get a date? Try altruism.
                    - Last but not least, by increasing your self-confidence and enthusiasm, altruism increases your level of persuasiveness, thus your ability to move an idea through the organization and/or to make it happen.
                    - Altruism in Practice
                        - Altruism can be as simple as offering to give someone a ride home, holding a door open for a stranger, or letting someone go in front of you at the market if you see they only have an item or two. Perhaps you stay late to finish a project and let your coworker go home early to be with his newborn baby. Or you let the harried man who is clearly in a hurry go in front of you at airport security.
                        - You can also perform a “random act of kindness,” such as paying the toll for the car behind you or letting a car go in front of yours in a traffic jam. Here’s why these random acts of kindness are useful: If you expect an external reward for altruism, you limit its effectiveness. But when you perform an anonymous act and can imagine whatever recognition, reward, or impact you want, you get the oxytocin boost that reciprocation would have given you.
                        - It’s worth noting that altruism won’t yield its full benefits if it’s motivated by guilt or performed with an expectation of reward. To ferret out whether or not you have a hidden expectation of reward, just ask yourself: If I know that I’ll never get recognition for doing this, do I still want to do it?
                        - For best results, Grant recommended that altruistic activities be tailored to the individual: “Either a cause they truly care about, or a use of their signature strength, or ideally both. We can learn a lot by observing our own past behaviors.” Looking back on your life, think about times when you performed altruistic (or, as Grant would call them, prosocial) behaviors. Which ones did you enjoy the most? From which ones did you get feedback that you had impact?
                        - “The mistake a lot of people make is that they try to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi. And that’s not sustainable for most of us.” In his research, Grant focused on doing a lot of five-minute favors, and paid attention to which ones energized him the most and which ones had the most impact. Interestingly, this brings to mind Mother Teresa’s philosophy of “doing small things with great love.”
                        - If you want the most effective altruism, look into impact philanthropy.
                    - Impact Philanthropy
                        - Until fairly recently, most philanthropists gave without much of a strategy in mind. They gave because they felt obligated, or because they were giving back, or to enhance their reputation, or because an issue had affected them personally. While (mostly) well intentioned, this kind of philanthropy’s effect has been spotty at best. But in recent decades there has been a big breakthrough in philanthropy called impact-focused philanthropy. The idea is to maximize social good by making the biggest difference with the capital donated. It’s doing good strategically, not just emotionally.
                        - “Our obsession is impact; we provide unrestricted money to organizations that have a scalable solution and a demonstrable ability to deliver,” says Kevin Starr, director of the Mulago Foundation.6
                        - The Mulago Foundation is a private foundation focused on high-impact philanthropy, and funds organizations that address the fundamental needs of the very poor. This is an area of particular passion for Olivia, who is a strong supporter of Mulago. “Frankly, it’s the biggest bang for your philanthropic buck that I know of,” she often says. Any organization in their portfolio has been rigorously evaluated or, in Olivia’s words, “they do the thorough due diligence so you don’t have to.” Stroll through their portfolio, pick one organization whose work you like, and donate. You’ll have a huge impact, and the satisfaction of knowing for certain you’re having an impact.
                    - Purpose + Altruism
                        - If there’s any magic formula, this is it.
                        - Josh Balk vividly remembers the night of his first breakthrough. “I was watching a documentary about the food industry,” he told us. “And then they started talking about the chickens.”
                        - Chickens live in stable social groups, Josh learned. They can recognize each other—and over a hundred other beings—by their facial features. They also converse with each other using twenty-four distinct vocalizations that communicate a wealth of information, such as whether a predator is traveling by air, land, or sea. They can identify images, remember objects hidden from view, play small musical instruments, solve problems, and even do simple math.
                        - Watching this documentary was probably tripling the total amount of time Josh had spent in his entire life learning about chickens, but he found he couldn’t tear himself away.
                        - Chickens form bonds with each other, the documentary continued, and other species, including ours. They show a wide range of emotions, such as grief when mourning the loss off an offspring or of a being they had bonded with.
                        - “Right at that moment, my dog walked into the living room, plopped down on the carpet, and laid his huge head upon my foot. And that’s when it hit me. Why love my dog, but completely ignore the pain of these other animals who could very clearly feel pain just as acutely?” That day, Josh decided to dedicate the rest of his life to reducing animal suffering, and it’s this sense of purpose that has driven him from breakthrough to breakthrough ever since.
                        - As you may know, the standard egg-industry practice is for hens to be crammed four or more to a tiny cage. Each caged hen is provided less space than an iPad in which to live her entire life. She’s unable to move more than a few inches and can’t spread her wings. (Imagine spending more than a year in a cage so small you can’t lift your arms. Ever.) Not surprisingly, the hens often go crazy from boredom and turn on each other, or even themselves, and that’s why the factories slice off the beaks of female chicks.
                        - After a year or two, the hens are ripped from their cages and stuffed inside a carbon dioxide box, where they suffocate to death. “This is what happens behind almost every carton of eggs you see in supermarkets,” explains Josh.
                        - The life of chickens in the egg industry is perhaps the one filled with the most suffering of any animal raised in food production. Shortly after hatching, male and female chicks are separated and thrown down separate chutes or onto separate conveyer belts that lead male chicks to a “macerating machine,” where they are ground up alive. Since males can’t lay eggs, they’re useless in egg production, and they’re a breed that’s too small to be of use to the meat industry.
                        - Chickens are the only farm animal excluded from the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, so there are no real rules or regulations to govern how they are treated in a factory environment. Every year, more than 200 million baby chicks are ground up alive. “Most of us agree that torturing animals is wrong. Yet without realizing it, most of us give money every day to an industry that does exactly that,” said an industry insider on condition of anonymity.
                        - This is why for Josh, changing the way chickens are treated was a first priority.
                    - He knew he couldn’t tackle the farming industry head-on; the egg companies weren’t going to change their practices just because he asked nicely. Realizing that these companies have no incentive to change their ways unless their customers demand it, Josh focused on the customers, like restaurant chains, grocery stores, and food manufacturers. And that’s how Josh ended up traversing an ice-encrusted parking lot in Minneapolis on a cold winter day.
                    - He was there to meet with about a dozen leaders at General Mills to try to convince them to stop purchasing eggs from caged hens.
                    - Some members of the GM team conceded that the treatment of these hens was, indeed, barbaric, and that switching to cage-free eggs was the right thing to do. But since caged-hen eggs are cheaper, the caging of chickens for General Mills’s eggs was to continue.
                    - Josh left that meeting feeling defeated, feeling like he had failed. He’d been going around the country meeting with companies and too often hitting brick walls of rebuttals: too much money, too much effort, or simply too much change.
                    - And that’s when he had a second breakthrough. What if food companies didn’t need eggs to make their products? What if we could make doing the right thing the cheaper and easier thing to do? If they couldn’t afford to go cage free, why not replace eggs altogether with something that works just as well and is actually more affordable? What if it also made the products less expensive for customers, the taste more delicious, and the food safer?
                    - Josh had been assuming that he had to fix the system from the inside. This constraint, he realized, didn’t need to be there. The entrenched system inside food companies wouldn’t change overnight, and in some cases wouldn’t change at all. So rather than keep running into brick walls, he removed the constraint and decided on a flanking maneuver.
                    - And that’s how Josh Balk and his childhood friend Josh Tetrick created Hampton Creek. The company’s first vision was to produce a plant-based replacement for egg ingredients used in end products like baked goods or dressings. But it was slow, waiting for companies that produce mayonnaise, dressing, cookies, cakes, and so on to test the replacement product and offer feedback, with no urgency about actually using them. “It was a frustrating time in the company’s history,” Josh admits.
                    - And that’s when “the Joshes,” as they are known, had a breakthrough. Instead of waiting for manufacturers to use their product, why not turn Hampton Creek into a company that makes those products on its own?
                    - That shift would turn Hampton Creek from a small ingredient company to what Conscious Company magazine called “the fastest growing food company in the world,” selling products like mayo, dressings, cookie dough, and cookies at grocers across the country. In fact, one of their products garnered so much buzz it attracted the attention of one of the giants in the industry—and not in a good way.
                    - In the industrial garage that functioned as the company’s headquarters, Josh Tetrick was chatting with his team when a courier walked in and handed him a large white envelope. Ripping it open, Josh drew out a single sheet of paper: a legal notice informing Hampton Creek they were being sued by Unilever, one of the world’s largest corporations.
                    - Unilever claimed that Hampton Creek’s Just Mayo was unfairly taking away market share from its iconic mayonnaise brands, Best Foods and Hellmann’s. How was the fledgling company being “unfair” to the global giant? The lawsuit referenced an antiquated regulation, dating from the early twentieth century, requiring products labeled as “mayonnaise” to contain eggs. Of course Hampton Creek’s Just Mayo was egg free. That was the whole point.
                    - The first thing that the Joshes felt was despair. How could their start-up company with a few dozen employees stand up to a $137 billion multinational food empire with armies of lawyers? “Of course we were scared,” Josh recalls. “Just fighting the lawsuit seemed like an unrealistic option; winning wasn’t even in the realm of possibility.”
                    - But the thing about being driven by a sense of purpose is that it gives you persistence, courage, a drive to figure things out. Perhaps that’s why eureka moments are a common theme in stories of social good, a reward for the determination, empathy, and boldness found in any ardent advocate. So the Joshes walked around and around their small San Francisco block, turning the situation to every angle they could consider. Their breakthrough came when they boldly turned it upside down. “What if, instead of being the worst thing that had ever happened to us, this lawsuit could be the best thing that ever happened to us?”
                    - The regulation upon which Unilever was basing its lawsuit specifically applied to products labeled as “mayonnaise.” Hampton Creek’s product doesn’t carry that label: it’s called Just Mayo. Not only were the Joshes on the right side of the legal battle, they also realized that public opinion would be on their side too. Who would take the side of Goliath attacking a David just trying to make a kinder world?
                    - The Joshes were right. Unilever was scolded by everyone from the New York Times, to the Wall Street Journal, to NPR, to the Associated Press, and even David Letterman. The first week of coverage alone brought Hampton Creek $21 million of free media coverage.
                    - Embarrassed by the media backlash, Unilever quietly dropped the lawsuit. Within two years, they came out with their own eggless mayonnaise.
                    - Only five years after Josh’s first breakthrough in the Minneapolis–St. Paul Airport, Hampton Creek has expanded to sell more than forty varieties of plant-based products, including cookies, cookie dough, pancakes, cakes, and cupcakes at tens of thousands of grocery locations across the U.S. and China. Bill Gates has predicted that it will be “one of the top three companies to forever change the food system.”7
                - Where will your breakthroughs take you?
                - SuperTool [3](3.md): Meditation
                    - “The word meditation describes a variety of deliberately mental activities,” Jon Lieff explains. ”Some define it as a type of concentration, others as a self-study of their own mental processes, and yet others as a method for transcending worry and concerns.”
                    - Meditation helps you increase mindfulness, which is critical for breakthroughs. What is mindfulness? Simply paying attention, moment by moment, to everything that is happening right now. George de Mestral noticed the burrs stuck to his clothes and his dog’s fur after a walk. Looking at the burrs under a microscope, he noticed they were made up of tiny hooks. This eventually led him to the creation of Velcro. This is also an example of associative thinking and an early example of biomimicry.
                    - The same is true of the pacemaker. A professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, Wilson Greatbatch was working on a device to record the rhythm of the heart when he pulled the wrong transistor out of a box. But he noticed the transistor emitted a steady, regular pulse, like a heartbeat. He figured this might be used to actually influence and steady a person’s heartbeat.
                    - Teflon is another good example. Roy Plunkett was working on a better refrigerator for DuPont in 1938. He placed a gas in canisters to wait overnight so he could continue with his experiment in the morning. But when he returned the canisters were empty. Yet they weighed the same. Cutting a canister open, he discovered it was coated with the slippery substance we know as Teflon. But think about how mindful he was. How observant. How easily he could have been annoyed and moved on.
                    - Regular meditators have more gray matter in their prefrontal cortex, and over time their brains become finely tuned willpower machines. Better yet, meditation directly increases the horsepower of your brain’s breakthrough council. A very recent study of a variety of meditation techniques showed increased connectivity in the areas related to memory, learning, and emotion.8
                    - Another significant recent study showed that all the main meditation techniques result in increased folding of the cortex, that is, increased gyrification. Increased gyrus formation is thought to increase processing of information, so you could literally become smarter by meditating.9
                    - Meditation is for the mind what a health and fitness program is for the body. It’s a mental gym, training the mind. Neuroscientists found that when you ask your brain to meditate, it gets better not just at meditating, but at a wide range of self-control skills, including attention, stress management, impulse control, and self-awareness.
                    - In other words, meditation is a lot like exercise. When the body is trained using exercise, it becomes healthy and fit, which then results in a whole host of well-documented physical benefits.
                    - Similarly, when the mind is trained using meditation, it also becomes healthy and fit, which then results in a whole host of well-documented benefits including improved health, reduction in stress, better concentration, increased happiness, more satisfying relationships, and even enhanced resistance to the flu. In some studies, meditation was shown to be more effective than exercise both in decreasing negative emotions and anxiety increasing focus.10
                    - Meditation will also turbocharge your sleep, helping you to get more from the same amount of sleep.11 (This is the one thing that gets all start-up founders to suddenly pay attention!)
                    - Meditation in Motion
                        - For those of us who have trouble sitting still, you can start by using your own motion as an object of meditation. Some meditation traditions have official “walking periods” during their retreats. Some movement practices, such as Tai Chi, Qigong, or 5Rhythms, are designed to be meditative. You can use running to meditate, though we recommend that you run without any music.
                        - You can, in fact, use any motion as an object of concentration. While doing the dishes, you can pay attention to the feeling of water splashing on your hands. Many teachers talk about the concept of minimeditations: using simple things like handwashing, walking up stairs, or brushing your teeth as opportunities to practice mindfulness.
                        - You can also focus on external motion. Watch a flame or a fire; it’s a great way to start. There’s a reason humanity has such a long tradition of fire gazing. You can also watch water or the rustling of tree branches in the wind.
                        - Whichever form of meditation you choose, we can guarantee that your mind will wander away from your object of focus many, many times. Don’t worry about how often that happens. Simply, gently, return to your object of concentration whenever you notice that your mind has wandered.
                        - Letting go is an act in which you release your need to control the situation, you stop telling yourself how it should be. Some teachers describe this as a catch-and-release process in which you get caught, release yourself, over and over again.
                        - Catch: “Why didn’t I . . .”
                        - Release: “Oh, there goes a thought about . . .”
                        - Catch: “I really should . . .”
                        - Release: “Just because a thought about . . . is floating through my mind doesn’t mean I have to believe it.”
                        
. . . and so on. 
                        - You’re not trying to quiet the mind, make it peaceful, make it happy. “Probably the most destructive myth about meditation is that it is a practice of quieting the mind,” meditation teacher Isaak Brown told us. “Eventually, the mind will get quieter, yes, but I wish no one ever shared that because now all my clients feel like they’re failing when their minds are chattering constantly when they meditate.”
                    - Just One Breath: “Don’t Worry, Be Lazy”
                        - Olivia’s dear friend and Buddhist meditator Chade-Meng Tan, author of How to Master Your Mind in 100 Minutes, Search Inside Yourself, and Joy on Demand, offers in his books practical, concise, funny advice on reaching inner peace. Hang out with Meng and he will convince you that meditation does not have to be hard. In fact, it can actually be quite easy. What is the absolute minimum amount of meditation practice before there is any sort of benefit? His answer: “One breath. Here, try it right now. It doesn’t get easier than this, I promise.”
                        - Putting It into Practice: Meng’s Lazy Practice
                        - You may close your eyes or keep them open. Take one slow, deep breath. For the duration of that one breath, give your full attention to your breath in a gentle way. Total and gentle attention on feeling your breath, that is all. If you prefer a more specific instruction, bring attention to the feeling in either your nose or the belly as you breathe.
                        - “Simply taking one mindful breath, any time and in any circumstance, is beneficial,” explains Meng. Taking slow, deep breaths stimulates the vagus nerve, which in turn activates the parasympathetic nervous system. That lowers stress, reduces your heart rate and blood pressure, and basically calms you down.
                        - Like many other meditators and habit experts, Meng recommends finding a routine cue. He explains that you can use as a trigger the moment you wake up, the moment you lie down to bed at night, or you can add an hourly chime to your smartwatch or smartphone and get a mindful breath reminder once per waking hour.
                        - “They are all great, I use all of them. The one cue I most highly recommend, however, is this: Every time you have to wait, take a mindful breath. I spend a lot of my time waiting, and I imagine you do too. I wait at traffic stops and at lunch queues. I wait at the airport, at the train station, and at the taxi stand. I wait for meetings to begin, for VIPs to arrive, for my computer to start up, for Web pages to load up. So much waiting. Every time I need to wait, I take one or more mindful breaths. This is a wonderful practice with many benefits.”
                        - Putting It into Practice: Creating a Habit of Taking Mindful Breaths
                        - •	Choose a cue, something that, when it occurs, activates the habit of taking a mindful breath. The cue we most highly recommend is any situation in which you have to wait.
                        - •	Whenever the cue occurs, take one slow, deep breath, and bring some amount of attention to that breath. For safety reasons (for example, if you’re walking or driving), you may need to maintain the appropriate amount of attention on your surroundings as you pay some attention to your breath.
                        - •	If taking that mindful breath makes you feel any better, simply notice that. That will be the reward that reinforces the habit.

            - 他的突破性研究让我们的工作成为可能，他的研究是这本书的科学依据，我们深深地感谢他的指导。
        - 前言 帮你捕获突破性灵感的最有效方法
            - 1905年，一个晴朗的春日。在瑞士的一个小城里，一位年轻的专利审查员把他妻子和一岁的儿子留在家里，去和自己的好朋友探讨一个难解的问题。他们喜欢互相交流，从哲学到物理，从艺术到电学，讨论内容无不涉及。这个早上，年轻的专利审查员想和他的朋友讨论一个困扰了他很久的问题。
            - 在过去的一年里，他集中全部精力钻研一个从10年前就开始构想的物理理论。这天，他把这一理论中困扰他的每一个细节都详细告诉了他的朋友。这两个年轻人花了一整天的时间逐个分析每一种观点和走出困境的思路。
            - 当太阳落山时，这个年轻人得出结论，他研究了10年的理论没有任何进展。他掉进了死胡同，挫败和沮丧涌上心头，他决定放弃。然后，这位叫阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）的年轻人拖着疲惫的身躯回家睡觉去了。
            - 让他的朋友吃惊的是，次日清晨，爱因斯坦急促地敲门造访。进门后，他来不及礼貌地问候朋友便脱口而出：“谢谢你，我已经完全解决了这个问题。”然后，爱因斯坦回家开始写作。他花了6周的时间，写出了人类历史上最伟大的科学成就之一：狭义相对论。
            - 我们的问题是，那天晚上，在爱因斯坦的大脑里到底发生了什么？经过多年的努力和思考，他掉进了死胡同，为什么答案却在他马上要放弃的时候突然出现了？
            - 爱因斯坦的经历是大脑产生突破性灵感的经典例子，它给我们提供了一个解决问题和看待世界的全新方法。信不信由你，如果你也产生过突破性灵感，同样的过程就曾发生在你的大脑里。
            - 萨尔瓦多·达利（Salvador Dali，超现实主义画家）和托马斯·爱迪生（Thomas Edison）也曾刻意地运用这一思维过程。达利会把胳膊肘架在桌子上，用手掌托着下巴，并在手掌里放一把勺子。他会让自己在思考中渐渐睡着，当他的肌肉放松时，勺子会掉到桌子上把他唤醒。在那个时刻，达利会在脑海中勾画出作品。爱迪生也有非常类似的习惯，他坐着打盹时，手里会抓着一把弹珠。如果弹珠落地，他会惊醒过来，就在此时写下心里想到的东西。
            - 突破性灵感就像蝴蝶
                - 对许多人来说，突破性灵感就像蝴蝶，美丽至极，却飘忽不定、难以捉摸。有些人认为，突破性灵感来源于努力和专注，越是专注于所寻求的突破，就越有可能获得成功。有些人则认为，突破性灵感是自发的，无法解释、不可预知。那些我们惊呼“尤里卡！（我明白了）”或者“啊哈，就是这样”的时刻就是灵感莫名到来之时。这种灵感的到来纯属偶然，无迹可寻。还有人则认为，突破性灵感可遇而不可求。然而事实是，每个人都能够获得突破性灵感。
                - 突破性灵感并非偶然的产物，它是可以被触发的。本书就将介绍如何获得突破性灵感。根据最新的神经科学研究，我们已了解了突破性灵感的产生过程以及获得突破性灵感的方法。突破性灵感就像蝴蝶，可能会沿着一条不可预知的路径飞翔，但如果我们织起了一张合适的网，就有可能捕捉到它们，这整个过程就是“蝴蝶思考术”。
                - 神经科学研究的最新进展已证明，这种看上去让人捉摸不定的“灵光一现”实际上是有迹可循的，它是一个综合思维过程的一部分。爱因斯坦说，突破性灵感是“自发的、突然降临的，也就是说，我们无法通过逻辑推理来得到它”。但这种“灵光一现”其实是一个长期过程后的必然结果。爱因斯坦说：“事后想想，我发现它其实是之前夜以继日思考的产物。”
            - 我们天生就会创造“蝴蝶”
                - 人类的大脑都能够产生突破性灵感，这是一种与生俱来的能力。我们天生就会创造“蝴蝶”。然而，我们可能还不知道创造“蝴蝶”的方法，以及怎样捕捉蝴蝶。我们需要学习“结网”的技巧，挥舞捕蝶网，也就是蝴蝶思考术。
                - 创意天才改变了世界，比如路易斯·巴斯德（Louis Pastear）、史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）和甘地（Mahatma Gandhi），他们的突破性灵感无一例外推动着人类科学与文明的进步。突破性灵感为现代医学带来了新的发明，比如起搏器。同样地，突破性灵感在家庭生活中也发挥着至关重要的作用：你可能会顿悟自己为什么无法深入亲密关系或是找到修复婚姻的秘诀。
                - 在商业活动中，突破性灵感同样重要：对企业来说，创新突破可能价值百万，甚至数亿。如今，各企业都投入大量的时间和金钱，用于营造创新的组织文化。但是，在那些员工的大脑里，究竟有没有产生过突破性灵感呢？即使每日身处鼓励创新的环境，但如果员工们未掌握形成突破性灵感的方法，结果也将事倍功半。
                - 你的老板有没有要求你用更具创新性的方法完成工作？你在职业生涯中有没有遇到过创新瓶颈期？创新突破是不是你升职的关键要素？不管你之前有没有体验过产生突破性灵感的经历，也不管你是否曾经怀疑过自己的天赋，现在有个好消息：突破性灵感是可以通过训练获得的。
                - 在本书中，你将了解到大脑产生突破性灵感的整个过程、你如何捕捉它，以及有什么因素会阻碍或加速这一过程。
                - 但是，有一点要事先声明：我们给你的不会是一个“神奇的秘方”。仅有一张“网”，并不一定能抓住“蝴蝶”，你需要的还有练习、耐心、技巧以及一点“运气”。每个人获得“蝴蝶”的方式不一样，不能简单复制他人的方法。突破性灵感是不可引导、不可重复、非线性的，它会受到各种因素的影响，是一个持续演进和迭代的过程。
            - 蝴蝶思考术，最有效地捕获突破性灵感
                - 蝴蝶思考术给你的是一个框架和一系列工具，它们能增大你获得突破性灵感的概率。“机会总是留给有准备的人”，在本书中，你能学到如何做好准备，让突破性灵感更快地到来。我们为你提供的技术和方法涵盖多个层面，从行为学、认知心理学到神经科学，甚至包括冥想，横跨了巅峰运动训练学、好莱坞方法派的表演流派等不同领域。从这个意义上说，蝴蝶思考术就像综合格斗一样，致力于从各家吸取长处，更重结果而非派别。这本书会引导你将科学付诸实践，加快你成长的进度。
                - 正确的方法可以提升人的创造力，我们已经用这些方法帮助过无数客户，包括美国陆军特种部队和位于硅谷中心的斯坦福大学的学生企业孵化器StartX。
                - 通过这些工具和技巧，我们的客户在各种不同的领域都取得过突破，比如发明新的医疗设备、打破高管团队的僵局等。这些喜人的成果已经改变了他们传统的做法和认知，本书的后续章节会介绍一些他们的故事。
                - 几十年来，我们的团队都着迷于突破性灵感的研究，甚至尝试了一些疯狂的实验。比如，在研究中运用运动心理学、荣格原型、深度催眠、感觉剥夺疗法、认知行为疗法（CBT）、正念认知疗法（MBCT）、接受与承诺疗法（ACT），以及其他各种实验和方法。我们已经把最好的见解和方法传递给了客户，现在，我们要把它们呈现给你。
                - 在本书中，你会学到来自各种科学领域的知识和技术，你需要做的就是把这些知识应用到生活的各个方面。你的生活将成为你的“实验室”，你会得到无限的实验机会。捕获突破性灵感需要练习，需要直面艰难甚至令人不适的训练过程，但你将获得令人难以置信的回报。
                - 要想取得理想的效果，练习必不可少。所以不要试图跳过练习环节，或者只选择做那些简单和有趣的练习。如果书中要求你闭上眼睛想象一个场景或者拿出纸笔写下一些东西，请一定要按照要求去做。因为书中的每个要求都有其各自的用意，都将切实影响你的蝴蝶思考术水平。
                - 在本书的第一部分，我们将讨论突破性灵感是什么，并通过介绍大脑内部的运作过程来观察蝴蝶思考术。你将在实践中感受到突破性灵感的形成，并认识到大脑在不同思维模式间转换的区别。
                - 然后，本书将介绍蝴蝶思考术的实际应用经验。你将从中学习如何使自己进入正确的心理状态，以及如何收集必要的事实、故事、知识和经验来促进你的创新过程。
                - 你还将了解到如何通过增加神经可塑性的水平以及利用大脑思考新想法时不断重塑自身的能力，来提高蝴蝶思考术的水平，进而迸发更多灵感。
            - 突破练习 30秒的神经可塑性训练
                - 每当有一个新的想法，你的大脑就会形成新结构。这是真的吗？当然是的。
                - 想知道那是什么感觉吗？现在就来感受一下。
                - 请在脑海中尽可能详尽地想象你平时的上班路线。想象一下你沿路看到的地标、街灯和交通标志；想象你会路过的建筑、商店或餐馆。
                - 那种大脑试图集合图像、以正确的顺序组装它们的感觉，就像第一次做某件事时会感到笨拙、吃力一样，对吗？此时，神经可塑性正在发挥作用，你的大脑正在形成新结构。
                - 在本书的第二部分，我们将讨论“蝴蝶”的天敌，即那些阻止你产生突破性灵感的因素。蝴蝶的3个天敌是蜘蛛、黄蜂和寒冷，在我们的大脑中也有相同的3种阻挡突破性灵感产生的天敌：畏惧、失败和不确定性。
                - 恐惧、失败和不确定性是阻碍你掌握蝴蝶思考术的障碍性因素。你的大脑里可能充满了创新的想法，它们在等待被释放。如果运用正确的技巧，你就可以消除这些消极因素，让你的“蝴蝶”展翅翱翔。如果你迫不及待想要开始这些技巧训练的话，请直接跳转到第二部分。
                - 在本书的最后一章，我们将探讨那些“超级工具”，它们可以让你的突破性灵感加速“冲出脑海”。针对那些喜欢研究的读者，我们在“科学附录”中给出了关于脑科学研究的更多信息。
                - 通过学习和使用本书中介绍的方法和技巧，你将突破障碍，打开通向突破性灵感的大门。这些突破性灵感能够改变你的事业、生活、身心健康、学习效率以及对这个世界，甚至对自己的看法。你的创新思维能力将指数型增长，不久，你就会有“脱胎换骨”的感觉。想要得到突破性灵感，你不必出类拔萃，不必太聪明，甚至不一定要接受过良好的教育，你只需要弄清楚自己在寻找什么以及如何找到它。
        - PART 1 蝴蝶思考术的5个阶段 成功捕获突破性灵感
            - 01 缤纷的蝴蝶：突破性灵感的多种模型
                - 该死！又有一滴墨水从拉迪斯洛·比罗（László Bíró）的钢笔里滴落到了绘图纸上，他厌恶地扔下了钢笔。比罗是一位匈牙利报纸编辑，靠写作谋生，他对自己的工作工具感到很失望。他的时间似乎都用在了给钢笔吸墨水或清理钢笔所产生的污迹上。
                - 当然，比起古老的羽毛笔，钢笔无疑是一个伟大的发明，它比羽毛笔好用多了。但是，钢笔还是会经常漏墨，把纸张弄脏，导致他必须整张重写。
                - 为什么钢笔不能使用像报纸印刷所使用的那种墨水呢？比罗心里很明白，报纸的印刷油墨对钢笔来说太稠了，无法正常从笔尖流出。墨水与笔无法匹配。运用印刷报纸的油墨的确是个好主意，但这还不算是突破性灵感。
                - 如果是改变墨水流出笔尖的方式，那就是突破性灵感了。比罗和他的哥哥决定把一个小圆球设置在笔尖上，让油墨从小圆球的后面滚出，而不是简单地从笔尖缝隙中流出。
                - 让我们明确一点，圆珠笔并不是比罗发明的，在他之前就有人尝试过，但其他人都没有成功。要么是笔尖无法顺畅地输送墨水，要么是流出的墨水太多以致污染了纸张。比罗却成功地制作出了书写顺畅的笔尖。
                - 在商业领域，突破一般是指，通过全新的方法解决某个问题或满足某种需求。
                - 突破并没有单一的定义，不过我们在此把它简单定义为打破某种限制的瞬间。这个限制可以是某个困扰你很久的难题，也可以是你始终无法理解的情境，还可以是你旧有的思维方式。
                - 作家、社会学家玛莎·贝克（Martha Beck）这样描述突破性灵感到来时的情景：“仿佛整个世界都不一样了，因为你看待问题的角度和深度都发生了巨变。天呐，这种感觉真好！”突破性灵感会让你的认知能力在瞬间实现从量变到质变的转换。尽管所有的突破性灵感都来自大脑的相同流程，但每一个突破性灵感的“抵达”方式却各不相同。
                - 突破性灵感主要有两种，即有意识的和无意识的。尽管表现形式并不一样，但有一些阻碍因素对这两种突破性灵感都有影响。比如，畏惧心理对上述两者都有阻碍作用，但在有意识的突破性灵感中，畏惧心理会在真正思考之前就产生作用，限制我们的思路，从而导致失败。
                - 而在无意识的突破性灵感中，畏惧心理会在开始思考后才悄悄溜进我们的脑海，致使我们不敢去实践产生的想法。比如，在一段失败的婚姻中，你可能会突然意识到应该尽早离婚（突破性灵感），但当考虑到离婚的后果以及离婚过程中的痛苦和焦虑后，就不敢去离婚（实践）了。或者，你突然意识到自己爱上了一个好朋友（突破性灵感），但想到在表白后可能会遭到拒绝，甚至连好朋友都做不了，就不敢去表白（实践）了。
                - 对于那些无意识的突破性灵感，仅仅停留在想法阶段是不够的，而是应该付诸行动。贝克说：“光有想法是不够的，实践才有意义。产生创新的想法仅仅是开始。”畏惧心理是实践路上的一个强大的“拦路虎”。
                - 我们把突破性灵感分成4种类型：尤里卡突破、隐喻型突破、直觉型突破和范式突破。了解突破性灵感的各种表现形式，能帮助你更好地了解“蝴蝶”并抓住“蝴蝶”。同时，这将帮助你找到更适合自己的类型，从而专注于能让你产生突破性灵感的蝴蝶思考术。
                - 这4种突破性灵感没有优劣之分，选择最适合自己的即可。
                - 尤里卡突破，不期而遇的顿悟
                    - 在希腊语中，“尤里卡”是“我突然懂了”或“就是这个”的意思，它已经成为一种指代语，指代一种突然的不期而遇的顿悟。
                    - “尤里卡”是古希腊数学家、科学家阿基米德（Archimedes）首先喊出来的。他住在公元前3世纪的西西里岛上。有一天，国王希罗想让阿基米德帮忙弄清楚，他的王冠是不是由纯金制成的。当时的人们知道纯金的密度，所以只要测量出王冠的密度，与纯金的密度做比较，就知道王冠是不是纯金的了。
                    - 测量王冠的质量比较容易，但测量王冠的体积就比较困难了。当时，测量一个形状规则的物体的体积是比较容易的，但王冠形状并不规则，这该怎么办？
                    - 这个问题一直困扰着阿基米德，直到有一天，他进浴盆里泡澡，当迈进浴盆时，水从浴盆里溢了出来。他突然意识到，溢出的水的体积和他的腿的体积是一样的。同理，把王冠放进盛满水的容器，溢出的水的体积不就是王冠的体积吗？阿基米德大叫：“尤里卡！”然后从浴盆里跳出，光着身子在叙拉古（今意大利锡拉库萨）的大街上忘情地奔跑。
                    - 当我们用很长时间反复思考一个难题时，就很容易出现尤里卡突破。有两位直升机维修师因为共同的爱好——赛车，而为美国陆军节省了上百万美元的支出。
                    - 在伊拉克战争中，沙漠的沙尘很大，直升机的挡风玻璃经常被沙粒刮坏，所以军队每月要花费数十万美元来更换挡风玻璃。挡风玻璃是用一种叫作“莱克桑”（Lexan）的聚碳酸酯材料制作的，不易碎裂但很容易被划伤。
                    - 巧的是，莱克桑还被用来制作赛车的挡风玻璃。为了解决挡风玻璃易被划伤的问题，赛车手们会把一种叫作“阿飞”（tearaways）的薄而透明的聚酯薄膜贴在挡风玻璃外侧，比赛结束后再撕掉，薄膜下面的莱克桑挡风玻璃不会有任何划痕。
                    - 在弗吉尼亚州的军队里，有两名驻扎直升机维修师碰巧也是赛车运动的粉丝。当他们检查直升机上挡风玻璃的受损情况时，突然想到赛车手的做法可能也适用于直升机。这种创造性的再利用经常在尤里卡突破中出现，事实上，赛车手起初也是借鉴了摩托车手的做法。摩托车手就是用这种方法保护他们头盔上的挡风玻璃的。
                    - 尤里卡突破往往发生在一瞬间，就像一道闪电划过脑海。有人说，那种感觉就像醍醐灌顶，仿佛冥冥之中有种声音在跟你说话，令人激动。
                    - 本书的作者奥利维娅就经常有尤里卡突破，她是个纯粹的实用主义者。通常，这些突破性灵感在她脑中形成的时候，会带有一张清晰的实践线路图以及对实践结果的充分信心。
                    - 如果一个问题困扰着你，那你就会不由自主地经常去想。而真正的突破经常发生在你已经准备放弃的时候。
                    - 事实上，詹姆斯·瓦特（James Watt）并不是蒸汽机的真正发明者。1764年，他在格拉斯哥大学修理一个叫作“纽卡门”的蒸汽引擎。这个引擎的工作效率很低，瓦特一直在思考该如何提高它的效率。1765年春天，当他在公园里散步时，突然想到应该装两个汽缸。尤里卡！经过瓦特的改装，引擎的性能有了显著改善。从此，人类社会开始真正迈进蒸汽时代。
                    - 一个世纪后，另一个动力突破也以非常类似的方式问世了。尼古拉·特斯拉（Nikola Tesla）数年如一日地钻研交流电动机。一天，当他在布达佩斯的一个公园里散步时，突然想到可以让驱动轴在3个稍微不同步的磁场的作用下转动，解决方案终于完成了。尤里卡！
                    - 产生这种突破性灵感的蝴蝶思考术似乎存在一种悖论。为了一个尤里卡突破，你必须先深陷于一个问题，对它苦思冥想。但是一段时间后，你必须放弃它，让思绪游荡，去做别的事情。当你忙于其他事情，而不是专注于这个问题时，就会得到一个尤里卡突破。如何在思考与放弃思考这两种模式之间切换，将是这本书教给你的最重要的东西之一。
                    - 维多利亚·斯帕达罗-格兰特（Victoria Spadaro-Grant）是意大利面巨头百味来公司的首席技术官，也是奥利维娅最喜欢的客户之一。格兰特说：“根据我的经验，尤里卡突破一般发生在我们面对巨大压力的时候……压力可能来自内部的自我加压，也可能来自外部。”
                    - 世界卫生组织发布的报告指出，饱和脂肪的使用量在持续增加。关注到这一信息，百味来公司的首席执行官克劳迪奥·科尔扎尼（Claudio Colzani）下令大幅减少对面包店中饱和脂肪的投入。格兰特面临“巨大的挑战”，因为她负责重新研发食品配方，并要在5个月内投入市场，她说：“当时，我们不知道该怎样在减少饱和脂肪的情况下保持食品的口味不变，而且投入新的制造工艺会增加数百万欧元的成本，从而对利润产生巨大影响。”
                    - 随着期限的临近，格兰特组建了一支“研发突击队”。“突击队”由6人组成，重点攻克技术难题。他们要打破所有规则，勇敢地尝试新实验。“我们意识到，要在如此短的时间内达成目标，就必须要把所有旧的规则扔到一边，去尝试新技术，在制作步骤、配方成本和营销方面大胆创新。最后，我们彻底改变了面包的传统脂肪配方。”尤里卡！
                - 隐喻型突破，把看似无关的事物叠加思考
                    - 1782年还没有子弹这种东西。枪支打出来的不是锥形弹，更像是铅块。那时，人们会把铅融化，等冷却后切成不同的形状，来制作弹丸。这样很难做出光滑圆润的弹头，因此弹丸歪歪扭扭、坑坑洼洼，甚至还有空心的。
                    - 使用这种弹丸很难射准。因为形状不规则，弹丸很容易受风的影响，轨迹就像纸飞机一样难以预测。所以1782年之前，决定枪手能否击中目标的关键因素是运气，而不是射击的技术。当时，英国正在美洲为统治殖民地而打仗，所以生产准头更高的枪支对大英帝国很有吸引力。
                    - 在那个时代，弹丸的生产成本非常高，需要耗费大量的人力、物力和时间成本。除了切割法，人们还尝试过把铅块溶解之后灌注到模具里的方法，但这样也会出现很多问题。比如在冷却过程中，小铅球的重心会下移并产生气泡，这将导致小铅球表面出现凹坑。
                    - 威廉·沃茨（William Watts）是住在英格兰布里斯托尔市的一位管道工，他的家是一栋三层的小楼。有个星期他一直睡不好，每天晚上都在做一个相同的梦：他正在街上走着，天上突然下起了雨，雨滴不是水做的，而是由铅块做的。铅块在他脚下堆积，当他弯腰捡起一块时，发现是一个完美的圆球。实际上，沃茨梦到了制作弹头的完美方法，即铅球可以从高空直接落下而成。然而，对当时的沃茨而言，这个梦到底意味着什么？他百思不得其解。
                    - 就这样过了几天，沃茨被梦境困扰，感到非常疲惫，他决定出去走走。在街上散步时，他突然明白了这个梦的含义。他立刻转身回家，开始工作。
                    - 沃茨改造了自己的家，在原有的基础上加盖了三层楼，并在每一层的地板上都钻了一个洞，形成通风井，最后在一楼地板上放了一个水槽。在顶楼，他把一桶铅水倒入铜漏斗，形成一串铅水滴，它们从六楼的洞中滴落，一直滴到一楼的冷水槽里。
                    - 他跑下楼去，从水槽中捞出一滴滴铅块，发现它们竟是完美的小圆球。原来，铅水在空中滴落的过程中，受到了重力的均匀拉伸，从而形成了完美的圆球。沃茨发现了制作弹头的完美方式，他把梦境变成了现实。1783年，他申请了专利。在这之后，这种制作弹头的塔楼遍布了英国、欧洲大陆以及美洲。
                    - 沃茨的大脑间接地向他展示了一个解决问题的方案，想出一个类比法并通过梦来与他分享。沃茨梦到了天上下“铅雨”，他苦思冥想这个梦的意义，最后终于明白了该怎么做。
                    - 隐喻型突破不像尤里卡突破那样直接，前者往往以隐喻或类比的方式呈现，你需要弄明白其中的含义，才能完成突破。阿基米德的尤里卡突破清晰、直接地呈现出了解决方案：腿浸入水和王冠浸入水直接关联。
                    - 如果沃茨的突破性灵感是尤里卡突破，他就会想出一个非常清晰的图像：高塔上滴落的金属水滴由于重力和空气摩擦形成完美的圆形，掉落到水槽中冷却后形成小铅球。然而，他梦到的却是天上下的“铅雨”，虽然“元素”类似，但和弹头并没有直接的联系。这些隐喻的元素需要解读才能联系到实际中。
                    - 有时，我们需要进行多种层面的解读，才能把一个无法描述的直觉和实际生活中的问题联系起来。隐喻就像一个虫洞，能够将看似相隔甚远的事情联系起来，让人把看似无关的事物叠加思考。和尤里卡突破不同，隐喻型突破所解决的问题可能和我们的身份不相关，就像那位管道工竟然解决了一个军事难题。
                    - 隐喻型突破经常会出现在奇怪的梦中。发明家埃莱亚斯·豪（Elias Howe）曾梦到自己被一个原始部落俘虏，部落里的一个人拿着长矛指着他。豪在梦里非常冷静，他注意到，那个长矛的头上有一个孔。根据这个梦，他解决了缝纫机上的一个难题。他在缝纫机针尖处设置了一个小孔，让线从中穿过。这项革新大大提高了缝纫机的效率，从而使服装制造业发生了革命性变化。
                    - 在仿生学领域，隐喻型突破的应用更为广泛。仿生学的意思就是把在自然中存在的原理应用于人类社会中。魔术贴的发明就是受到了自然界中的灌木毛刺的启发。牡蛎和藤壶粘到岩石上所用的防水胶水，让外科医生找到了缝合病人伤口的新方法。
                    - 莱特兄弟（Wright Brothers）曾经花费很长的时间观察鸟类飞行的情景，以解决飞机的动力难题。他们发现，鸟类通常会弯曲翅尖以保持平衡。但就飞机而言，这样做显然是不可能的。威尔伯·莱特（Wilbur Wright）经营一家自行车店，有一天他正在把玩手中的长长的内胎箱，突然想到，如果整个飞机的机翼都弯曲的话，那就可以控制飞行的平衡了。于是“机翼翘曲”应运而生，人类进入了飞行时代。
                - 突破工作坊 隐喻型突破，领导团队合作的有力工具
                    - 隐喻型突破也是领导团队合作的有力工具。硅谷一家非常成功的公司的高管团队曾邀请我们一起参加他们的攻坚讨论会。他们的核心产品曾取得巨大的成功，但他们也感受到，资金雄厚的竞争对手正在后面紧追不舍。他们是应该加倍研发自己的核心产品，从而占领市场，还是应该拓展到一个更陌生的蓝海领域呢？
                    - 高管团队不断讨论，甚至使用了逻辑和线性论证。有些人争辩说，他们应该待在自己熟悉的领域，因为他们已经在那个领域投入了大量的时间和金钱，建立了自己的品牌，赢得了投资者和客户的信任。另一些人则认为，不创新就会死，他们别无选择，必须展翅飞向未知的蓝海领域，这才是卓越的公司应该做的。这等于在暗示支持生产原有产品的人缺乏追求卓越的勇气。会议进展得并不顺利，那些坚持生产核心产品的人据理力争。双方你来我往，争论不休。
                    - 本书作者朱达走到房间前面，在大白板上画了两个大方格。他按照这两个观点将高管团队分成两个小组，给他们笔，并让他们画出他们对未来的憧憬。起初有人抱怨和抗议，他们不知道怎么画。奥利维娅向他们保证，就算画得不好也是完全可以接受的。慢慢地，两队人马开始动笔画画。
                    - 当这两个小组完成画作时，他们惊讶地发现，两队的画作并没有什么不同。两组都画了一条小路蜿蜒到天边，路上的人们脸上都挂着微笑，并且走的路越远微笑的人就越多。大家都很困惑，既然他们的画作如此相似，他们为什么争吵？
                    - 当每个小组分别描述他们的画作时，差异就非常明显了。一组人用道路上的弯道代表公司对市场的反应，公司需要按照市场来进行调整。另一组人则用弯道表示他们应该在市场上进行“超车”。房间里安静了一会儿，局势开始变得清晰。在这种情况下，隐喻的表达打破了分歧，揭示了问题的实质。想要坚持核心产品，然后根据市场进行调整的人们清楚地看到，他们是出于对未知的恐惧而做出反应的。公司最终决定进入蓝海领域。3年过去了，这个决定被证明非常成功。
                    - 可视化思考是创意天才的共同特质。我们采访的许多人都随身带着小速写本，他们会随时把产生的想法画在纸上。相较于语言和逻辑论证，可视化思考使用的是不同的大脑部位。如果你不擅长绘画，可视化思考可能更有效，
                - 直觉型突破，释放大脑深处的感觉
                    - 想象一下，在加利福尼亚州的沙漠中，有一片干涸的湖床，这里只有红色的硬土、灰尘以及高温天气。这便是1947年美国军队进行绝密超音速飞行试验的场地。测试的是贝尔X-1型飞机，它的机翼很薄，形状就像一颗子弹。当时，美国空军实验中的火箭发射机终于突破了音障。
                    - 不幸的是，每当飞行员把飞行速度升至接近音速时，飞机的控制能力就会大大降低。如果方向舵不听使唤，在穿越风暴时整架飞机就会猛烈翻滚。有一架飞机甚至完全解体了。工程师们对此束手无策，没有一次试飞能成功达到必要速度的85%。牺牲的飞行员人数不断增加。
                    - 查克·耶格尔（Chuck Yeager）来自西弗吉尼亚州的乡下，是当时最好的空军飞行员之一。在不到24岁的时候，他已经是一个传奇人物了。在第二次世界大战中他立下了赫赫战功，被称为王牌战斗机飞行员。他似乎就是为飞行而生的。
                    - 在实践飞行中，耶格尔经历了种种困难：当他接近音速时，飞机失去了控制，剧烈震动摇晃，像布娃娃一样在风中颠簸。尽管如此，耶格尔却确信当速度越接近音速时，飞行将变得越容易。
                    - 他怎么能这么肯定？当时还没有出现航天工程这一学科，他的观点遭到了博士们的反对，这些博士可是成功把冷却到零下183摄氏度的液态氧和乙醇混合起来，制成火箭推进剂的人。他们确信，超音速飞行已经遇上了物理限制，进行这种飞行试验无疑是自杀。
                    - 但是，这个石油工人的儿子、只受过高中教育的耶格尔确信自己能做到。他有一种强烈的直觉，愿意拿自己的生命搏一次，他就是知道自己能够成功。
                    - 1947年10月14日，在这个决定性的早晨，耶格尔进入贝尔X-1型飞机的驾驶仓。他和飞机脱离B-29型轰炸机的机舱后，他立即启动引擎，直冲云霄。
                    - 当他接近300米／秒时（已经达到必要速度的90%），飞机开始颠簸翻滚，控制系统变得迟钝。但当他到达326米／秒时，他通知地面，飞机已经恢复控制。这回，这个乡村男孩打破了那些博士们的预言。
                    - 突然，指针仪表开始乱跳，随即破表，地面指挥中心的人们听到了那一声著名的“音爆”。飞机不仅飞得平稳，而且当越来越接近音速时，飞机轻松地越过了音障。
                    - 耶格尔是怎么知道的？他怎么有勇气冒生命危险去做这个实验？直觉型突破无法用任何逻辑来解释，很多时候，当人们经历直觉型突破时，他们并不知道什么方案会奏效，但他们就是知道这样做一定能成功。
                    - 如果一个人在某一领域的技术达到了炉火纯青的地步，就能对这一领域有相当准确的直觉判断。研究人员塔米·桑德斯（Tammy Sanders）这样描述直觉：“它是一种模糊的、没法解释的确信感，从经验中来，受环境线索的指引。”这种感觉通常出现在发明家、模型建造师以及产品设计师身上。在不知不觉中，你已经积累了无数经验、技巧，而这些一直都埋藏在你的大脑深处。
                    - 发明大王托马斯·爱迪生就是借助直觉型突破发明了留声机。有一天，他在摆弄一个电话模型，一时兴起，摸了一下振动膜片上面的指针。他说当时有一种直觉，指针会在振动膜片下方的锡纸上留下压痕。当指针再次通过在锡纸上留下的轨道压痕处时，会再现之前的声音。他果然是对的。
                    - 虽然尤里卡突破和直觉型突破都有“确信感”的特质，但尤里卡突破是推理的终点，而直觉型突破仅仅是一个开始。在直觉型突破这种模式下，不要希冀会有某种“灵光一现”的感觉，不过你可能会感到相当镇定，仿佛把车开到了十字路口后，你很清楚要向左转。
                    - 如果读到这里，你感觉不知所云，那么直觉型突破可能并不是你的“菜”。如果你能理解前面提到的那种感觉，则说明你适合直觉型突破。
                    - 在处理直觉型突破时，你是否应该比处理尤里卡突破更有自信呢？是的，你必须要相信自己，那种感觉可能无法用逻辑解释和证明，但它就是正确的。
                - 突破工作坊 领导者需要把自己的直觉型突破讲清楚
                    - 领导者必须清楚具体地传达他们的直觉型突破，这样才能在组织中获得更大的支持。但有时，直觉很难说清楚。
                    - 两星上将达纳·皮塔德是驻扎在得克萨斯州埃尔帕索市布利斯堡的美国陆军部队的指挥官，他管辖着4万人和大量军事装备。朱达曾与皮塔德将军一起工作，当他听说这位将军喜欢在要塞周围种圣诞树的时候，感到很吃惊。针对这个问题，朱达向将军请教。
                    - 在一段令人尴尬的沉默后，将军解释道，这样做是希望把布利斯堡变成环保型要塞。原来，布利斯堡位于得克萨斯州西部的沙漠，它的面积比整个罗得岛州还要大。如果在这里种树，既可以涵养水土，又可以提供阴凉。但是朱达说：“将军，这些树种在路的两边，看上去很低矮，无精打采，没有生气。”
                    - 朱达问将军，当他看到这些树时，有什么想法。将军凝思了一会，仿佛已经意识到，别人和他的看法可能不太一样，他需要把自己的直觉说出来。
                    - “我看到了这些树在30年后的景象：它们枝繁叶茂，为道路提供阴凉；粗粗的根紧紧抓住土壤；鸟儿在枝头搭窝、歌唱；树叶散发水汽，让沙漠不再那么干燥。”
                    - 随着将军的描绘，下属们频频点头，但还是没有完全被说服。朱达感觉出将军对未来有自己的直觉，而且这个直觉是正确的，但在将军的描述里，好像还缺少一种东西。将军对军事要塞未来的考虑绝不仅仅只停留在环保上，他没有把他的意思完全用言语表达出来。这就是直觉型突破的悖论，有时言语无法彻底把这种想法解释清楚。那么，在将军的描述里，到底缺少了什么呢？
                    - 当再次开会的时候，朱达问皮塔德将军，为什么他想把布利斯堡变成一个环保型要塞？将军变得很激动，他说：“问得好。我们的军事力量需要能源供给，现在这些能源来自石油。无论是从环境还是从国家安全的角度出发，这种依赖都是很危险的。”皮塔德将军对下属们说：“如果我们改变能源获取的方式，在30年后，就可能会拥有一个更加和平的世界。种树仅仅是开始，我们要确保自己走在正确的道路上。”
                    - 皮塔德将军想让军队明白环保的好处。这是一个很好的直觉型灵感，我们不知道30年后他的计划是否能够奏效，但他的解释帮助他的下属明白了他的真实想法和目的。
                    - 突破性灵感的类型没有高低优劣之分，有的人可能经历过不同种类的突破性灵感，有的人可能只熟悉其中一种。关键是要知道，哪一种适合自己，然后去加强训练。
                - 范式突破，揭示一个彻底改变认知的大理论
                    - 和范式突破相关的都是大名鼎鼎的人物，比如牛顿（Isaac Newton）、爱因斯坦、海森堡（Werner Karl Heisenberg）、达尔文（Charles Robert Darwin）。这种突破性灵感影响了全人类，改变了我们看世界的方式。
                    - 范式突破是对某种规律的深刻洞察。当牛顿看到苹果落地时，他意识到同样的力量也主导着地球上所有的物体。于是，他发现了万有引力，改变了整个思想系统。
                    - 尤里卡突破和范式突破都很清晰、直白，但它们在传达的内容上有所不同。范式突破揭示的是宏观理论，是一种可以解释多种现象的普遍原则，不一定涉及具体的应用。尤里卡突破则给我们提供了解决实际问题的直接有效的方法。
                    - 这两种突破性灵感给我们带来的心理和生理上的感受也不尽相同。尤里卡突破会给我们带来一种兴奋和激动的感觉。我听说过一个故事，美国国家航空航天局的一名科学家曾在开车下班离开时，突然想通了一个困扰他很长时间的问题，他把车停在了路中间，车门都没关就直接跑回了办公室。他的同事们下班时，都只能小心翼翼地绕过他那辆还开着车门的车。即使是一个很谨慎的人，一旦有了尤里卡突破体验，也会变得忘乎所以。
                    - 相反，范式突破产生的影响更巨大，但带来的体验则更冷静，那是一种敬畏和惊奇多于兴奋的感受。同样，它也会给我们带来智识满足感，而未必在金钱和实用性上有价值。它通常需要大量的后期工作才能成形，比如爱因斯坦的相对论，这样复杂的理论是不可能在他的脑海中立即成形的。事实上，爱因斯坦花费了整整六周才写出相对论。大多数的范式突破都需要理性的完善和补充。
                    - 范式突破是最稀有但最有力量的一种突破性灵感。它的产生需要个人能力，也需要时机和运气。爱因斯坦的范式突破是在过去一百多年的众多小突破的基础上形成的，比如说亚历山德罗·伏特（Alessandro Volta）发现并描述了电的特性，詹姆斯·克拉克·麦克斯韦（James Clerk Maxwell）更精确地定义了电，阿尔伯特·迈克耳孙（Albert Michelson）和爱德华·莫雷（Edward Morley）推翻以太的存在并更准确地测出了光速，路德维希·玻尔兹曼（Ludwig Boltzmann）捍卫了原子的概念，马克斯·普朗克（Max Planck）发现了量子定律。上述的每一个发现和突破都是爱因斯坦通往范式突破的铺路石。这一系列发现被爱因斯坦称为“早期的智慧启蒙”。爱因斯坦处于范式转变的关键期，他的确“站在了巨人的肩膀上”。
                    - 这样说并不是要否定爱因斯坦的贡献，而是要说明外部因素在范式突破产生的过程中发挥的作用。范式突破看起来就像突破性灵感中的“皇冠”，但我们不能也不用刻意去追求它。
                    - 取得范式突破的诱惑是显而易见的。如果获得范式突破，每个人都会知道你的名字，你的头像甚至会挂在大学的墙壁上。但是，范式改变者并非一开始就刻意追求转变范式，创意天才们需要记住这一点。
                    - 许多人曾迷失在刻意地追求某种规律或定理的道路上。美国国家航空航天局的科学家彼得·奇斯曼（Peter Cheeseman）说过，他的许多同事曾去追逐量子力学的精髓，却陷入了死胡同。人工智能专家、企业家、天使投资人巴尼·佩尔（Barney Pell）称这种现象为“聪明人干蠢事”。奥利维娅的科学家父亲曾回忆：“在我拿到博士学位后的第一个10年里，我刻意追逐获得诺贝尔奖却一无所获。然后我放弃了，开始做实用的科学，却意外地取得了很多成果。”
                    - 不同种类的突破性灵感会产生同样的效果，你需要做的就是相信自己的大脑能够产生突破性灵感。
                - 本章小结 突破性灵感的多种类型
                    1. 突破性灵感是你的知识或理解的瞬间跃迁，让你突破原有障碍，以全新的方式看待事物、理解事物。
                    2. 突破性灵感有4种类型：尤里卡突破，隐喻型突破，直觉型突破和范式突破。
                    3. 尤里卡突破清晰、突然、完整、立即可用，最可能发生在放弃思考这个问题之时。尤里卡突破的产生将给我们带来极大的兴奋感。
                    4. 隐喻型突破通常以隐喻或类比的形式出现，需要解读才能完成。它往往出现在梦里，发生于大脑把两个看似无关的事物或想法连接起来之时。
                    5. 直觉型突破不合常理，往往只是一个开端，引领我们走上一条更长的路径。
                    6. 范式突破的表现方式清晰、直白，与尤里卡突破有些相似。它往往揭示一个宏大的理论，但无法立即产生实际应用。它给人们带来的是惊奇和敬畏的感受，而不仅仅是兴奋。范式突破是最罕见也是影响力最大的突破类型。
            - 02 阶段1：发现幼虫 突破性灵感来自何处
                - 1965 年的一天，在佛罗里达州的清水市，滚石乐队创始人之一基思·理查兹（Keith Richards）在汽车旅馆中醒来。当时的滚石乐队还没有名气，他住不起大酒店。宿醉的理查兹还没有完全清醒，他在朦胧中发现吉他就在身边，录音机还在一直录音。理查兹把磁带倒回去，按下播放键，在长达一个小时的录音中，有59分钟都是他的呼噜声，但在最开始的半分钟里录下了一小段音乐。这一小段音乐成就了滚石乐队最著名的歌曲之一——《满足》（Satisfaction）。事后说起来，理查兹甚至想不起他曾经碰过录音机。
                - 信不信由你，理查兹所经历的突破时刻与爱因斯坦发现狭义相对论的模式是一样的。这一模式也在我们采访过的很多伟大的创新者身上得到了验证。如果你曾在洗澡时有过顿悟，那你已经体验到了这种模式。
                - 当你在为某个问题冥思苦想或因人际关系上的困境而发愁、担心时，你的脑海中便存在着顿悟的可能。那些时候你往往一直在想这些问题，却找不到答案。这时，你决定去洗个澡。当全身浸入水中，大脑处于放松状态不再想这个问题后，突然之间，你就找到了答案。
                - 那么，你的顿悟时刻与理查兹和爱因斯坦的有什么相同之处呢？当开始洗澡时，你的大脑就不知不觉“切换了状态”。之前，你有意识地把所有精力都集中在问题上，而在洗澡时，你的思维会游离到其他事物上，无所事事地空想或者“什么也不想”。神经科学家研究发现，产生突破性灵感的关键就是，让大脑能够在专注和漫游这两种状态之间切换。
                - 执行模式和默认模式：让两种模式协作
                    - 我们都很熟悉专注的状态，它在生活中很常见，你可以把它看作“执行模式”，即为了把任务完成而让大脑处于高效运转的状态。这时，我们的目标明确，指向性强，在应对外在压力（比如时间和金钱等）时有优势。大脑中负责进行这种模式的区域叫作“执行网络”（executive network，简称EN）。
                    - 执行网络位于大脑前叶，主要负责执行任务、完成计划。对此你应该并不陌生，因为你曾在学校用十多年时间训练这一区域。事实上，读这本书时你也在使用这一脑区。
                    - 大脑的执行网络让我们的祖先学会了观察星象，掌握了种植庄稼的最佳时期，完成了像建造金字塔这样复杂的任务。这一脑区也负责人的社会抑制，即在社会中进行自我控制。如果没有它，你就会像一个3岁小孩一样为所欲为，反之，你就是一个合格的、负责任的、有生产能力的“社会人”。
                    - 但是，执行网络是无法独立产生突破性灵感的，它需要能够产生顿悟的漫游网络的帮助。因而，我们还要激活大脑中的创造性网络，它也被称为“默认网络”（default network，简称DN）。我们可以把默认网络看作一个会议室，有许多突破天才在这里开会，他们互相交流，探讨各种不成熟的观点和大胆的假设。
                    - 大脑的默认网络是人类一切创造和发明的诞生地，生活中的各种发明和突破性灵感都和大脑的这一区域有关。要是没有这个区域，世界上很多伟大的发明都可能不会产生。如果说执行网络给了我们执行和完成任务的能力，那么默认网络则给了我们分析和看清复杂事物本质的能力。
                    - 默认网络是大脑的重要组成部分。研究表明，大脑中的默认网络就像心脏或肾脏一样重要。事实上，本书本可以用来全篇讲述默认网络：它在大脑的什么位置，它是如何工作的，以及如何了解和使用它。但这些还远远不够，仅靠默认网络仍然无法让我们产生突破性灵感。
                    - 产生突破性灵感需要默认网络和执行网络的协同工作，需要大脑在这两个模式中不断切换。这让理查兹能够写出《满足》这首歌，让爱因斯坦能够发现狭义相对论。事实上，人类社会的大部分发现与发明都是这种切换模式下的产物。
                    - 在本书中，我们将介绍默认网络是如何工作的，你该如何更有效地使用它以及如何激发它的潜能。我们还将更进一步教你如何让这两个网络协作起来，也就是怎样从一个模式切换到另一个模式。这种模式切换才是产生突破性灵感的关键。
                    - 当大脑通过各种感官获取信息时，部分信息直接应用于某些特定环境，比如：跳过路前方的绊脚石；踩下刹车；有人进屋时，我们就停止唱歌等。
                    - 我们也会利用大脑获得的信息来建立某种行为模式。有些行为模式较为简单，比如：我喜欢吃马塞洛店里的比萨；我不喜欢接妈妈的电话，因为这会给我一种愧疚感，暗示我没有主动给她打电话。这些行为模式在我们的日常生活中占据很重要的地位。
                    - 还有一些更复杂的行为模式，比如把各种音符、和弦组合起来创作一首流行摇滚乐。即使再努力，理查兹大脑中的执行网络也无法单独创作出如此美妙的旋律。
                    - 1965年的滚石乐队还是一个中小型乐队，他们刚出了自己的第四张专辑，开始进行首次全美巡演。他们迫切需要一首能够震撼人心的歌曲，让乐队的名字家喻户晓。理查兹很清楚这一点，整日都在想着如何写出一首这样的歌曲。他的执行网络划定了目标和需求，但对解决方案却束手无策。
                    - 理查兹睡觉的时候，他的执行网络才能不去想那些烦人的问题。我们可以想象一下他的执行网络：从大脑前台走出来，进入更深处的中心位置。在那里，有一间秘密休息室，所有的突破天才就在这里开会。其实，我们每个人的大脑中都有一间这样的休息室。
                    - 当理查兹的执行网络在大脑前台工作时，突破天才休息室的灯光会变暗，因为大部分脑力都在供应执行网络的运转。而当这个区域休息时，脑力又回到了突破天才休息室。所以，当理查兹的执行网络打开休息室的门时，看到了里面热闹极了的场景：
                    - 这间休息室里有宽大的沙发，有各种小吃、零食和饮料，当然还有记事用的白板、笔记本和各种颜色的笔。达·芬奇（Leonardo da Vinci）坐在角落里，手里拿着笔，在本子上涂鸦；拿破仑（Napoleon Buonaparte）在摆弄着他的玩具士兵；欧几里德（Euclid）挥舞着居里夫人（Marie Curie）给他的荧光棒；米开朗琪罗（Michelangelo）正在把软彩泥裹在铅笔上；圣女特雷莎·阿维拉（Teresa de Avila）正在写日记，但伊拉斯谟（Erasmus）一直在问她关于人类命运的问题；史蒂夫·乔布斯对爱因斯坦说，他的脑洞开得不够大；孙子对大家讲述着他过去领兵打仗的故事；圣女贞德（Joan of Arc）一直在念叨着法国人对她的背叛；福尔摩斯（Sherlock Holmes）在研究着客厅的环境，寻找着线索；女飞行员阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特（Amelia Earhart）则在打盹。
                    - 理查兹的执行网络推门进入休息室，对大家说：“注意啦！我们需要一首主打歌，你们有什么好主意？”方向已经确定，目标已经明确，接下来的事情就要交给休息室里的天才们完成了。执行网络需要离开休息室，做些其他的事情，比如去散散步、泡泡澡、缝缝袜子，这些事情必须是简单的小事，否则会把脑力从休息室带走。
                    - 与此同时，在休息室里，灯光逐渐变亮，天才们开始工作了。他们互相交谈，写写画画，用积木建造模型。米开朗琪罗和达·芬奇画着草图，孙子和拿破仑在讨论着战略和对策，特雷莎和伊拉斯谟在深思，而圣女贞德则在担忧着结果。不要以为我们在开玩笑，这就是大脑默认网络所做的各种工作。在休息室里，灵感在不断迸发，不同的思想在相互交流和碰撞。
                    - 执行网络偶尔会回来看看讨论的结果，有时也会针对某些问题做出一些评论或建议以便纠正讨论的方向，然后又出去做白日梦了。直到在洗澡或散步的某一时刻，那些讨论问题的天才们开始变得异常兴奋，终于有了结果。理查兹就是在夜里睡觉时迸发出了好点子。
                    - 在清水市的那个夜晚，理查兹大脑中的天才们向执行网络展示了这首歌开头的八个小节和一句歌词。天才们和执行网络一起看着它，然后互视对方，接着就大声说：“是的，就是它了！”执行网络把理查兹叫醒，让他把这些音节录下来，然后就“掉线”，让理查兹继续睡觉。
                    - 这就是突破性灵感在我们大脑中的形成过程。
                - 突破工作坊 创作《满足》时，两种模式是如何协作的
                    - 执行网络设定目标：写一首主打歌！
                    - 理查兹睡着了，执行网络走出了大脑前台。
                    - 脑力供应天才云集的休息室，大脑进行模式切换。
                    - 天才们想出了一首歌，执行网络认为这会是一首大热的歌。
                    - 执行网络把理查兹唤醒并让他录下这首歌。
                    - 任务完成，执行网络离开大脑前台，理查兹重新入睡。
                    - 除了完成许多事务，执行网络负责为默认网络里的天才们把握讨论的方向，并在讨论结束后执行结果。这就好比执行网络给休息室里的天才们一堆乐高积木，并说：“看看你们能用它堆出什么。”这些乐高积木就像大脑的神经一样吸附在一起，而天才论坛会不断尝试新的连接，有时候可能是简单的堆砌，但有时候会造出机器人、宇宙飞船或者相对论。
                - 在两种模式之间转换，才能获得突破性灵感
                    - 早在1929年，神经科学家就发现，我们的大脑一直处于活跃状态，大脑的理性思考常常伴随着背景噪音。近些年，有研究证实，这些背景噪音会对大脑产生正面影响。
                    - 现代人做事偏好有逻辑、有条理、有效率，默认网络却不是这样的。默认网络的发现者马库斯·拉切尔说：“直到最近，我们都聚焦在让大脑做特定的事，而忽视那些背景、默认无意识、非定向的活动。”默认网络是我们拥有的最强有力的工具之一，却并非专注于完成任务。
                    - 专注对我们的工作和生活非常重要，侧重执行就是侧重可行性。但那些顶尖的演员、明星、创意天才却是在两个网络切换的过程中找到突破性灵感的。
                    - 拉切尔博士在1997年首次发现了大脑中的默认网络。在没有任务的情况下，大脑会默认转到这个模式，因而称之为默认网络。这种模式从未真正关闭，但会在大脑专注于某个任务的时候平静下来。任务结束后，大脑又会回到默认模式。比如，在工作间隙抬头往窗外看，叮叮！大脑就切换到了默认网络；去休息室沏一杯咖啡，叮叮！大脑又切换到了默认网络。
                    - 拉切尔博士告诉我们，这种无意识的过程是“人类大脑在大多数情况下的状态”。所以，默认网络一直都是开启的，只有在我们集中注意力去完成某项任务时才会被打断。因此，在一般情况下，默认网络所需要的能量是执行网络的20多倍。
                    - “大脑一直都在活动着，不论你是在清醒状态还是在睡眠状态，也不论你是在工作还是在做白日梦，大脑几乎全天候运转。”拉切尔博士说。
                    - 不幸的是，大多数人都忙于工作，忙于完成任务，留给天才论坛的时间越来越少了。在一个崇尚高效执行的社会中，我们连静下心来坐一会儿的时间都在不断减少。殊不知，默认网络中的天才论坛对产生突破性灵感非常重要。
                    - 19世纪中叶，化学家们试图找到石油的主要成分苯的分子结构。德国化学家弗里德里希·奥古斯特·凯库勒（Friedrich August Kekulé）给大脑的执行网络下达了任务。有一天晚上，当他关掉了大脑的执行模式，悠闲地在火炉前打盹时，默认网络的天才们给他画了一张图，图中一条蛇正在吃自己的尾巴。
                    - 凯库勒脑中的突破天才们给他提供了一个隐喻，而他的执行网络将这个隐喻解读了出来：苯是一个环型结构。这样，凯库勒将有机化学结构引入了新纪元，并影响了医药业的兴起。你知道为什么全球这么多大型制药公司都是德国企业，比如默克、拜耳、罗氏、先灵？因为凯库勒把他的实验室建在了德国波恩大学。
                    - 与爱因斯坦、爱迪生、达利、特斯拉、瓦特以及无数其他领域的创意天才一样，凯库勒通过在执行模式和默认模式之间的转换，获得了突破性灵感。事实上，拉切尔博士告诉我们，他也是在结束紧张会议之后，在走廊上得到了灵感，进而发现了默认网络。
                    - 那么，我们怎样才能切换到天才模式呢？
                - 想着问题入睡，突破性灵感产生的加速器
                    - 亚当·齐亚（Adam Cheyer）是苹果手机人工智能语音助手Siri的创造者。开发Siri是一个巨大而复杂的工程，它涉及各种各样的变量，比如需要听懂各种说话方式，需要根据人们所说的只言片语查找有用的信息并以实用的方式回答。这对齐亚来说是巨大的挑战。不过，齐亚有一个秘密武器：进入他的天才模式。
                    - 虽然开发Siri是一项十分有条理的工作，但齐亚并不打算完全依赖逻辑解决每一个问题，他对我们说：“我每次都会带着问题入睡。”齐亚与达利、爱迪生一样，都发现了睡前和半醒状态的强大突破力。在即将入睡和即将醒来的时候，大脑中的天才论坛极其活跃。
                    - “我在11点左右上床睡觉，同时脑中还在思索着一个问题。”他说。通过思索问题，齐亚给执行网络下了指令，明确了天才论坛的讨论方向。在他睡觉时，他大脑中的天才们会给他带来有创意的联想和突破，早上醒来后，他就用执行网络把昨晚的收获记录下来。
                    - 在设计Siri期间，齐亚每天早上都会把睡觉时产生的想法整理出来，并应用到尚未成型的Siri模型中。最后，他终于得到了一个令人满意的成果，并向全世界展示了自己的作品。
                    - 处于睡前和半醒状态时，我们负责控制行为的大脑额叶停了下来，而默认网络得以高速运转。
                - 进入睡前状态，聚焦问题
                    - 半醒状态是我们睡了一段时间后将要醒来时的状态，睡前状态则是我们即将要入睡时的状态。
                - 突破练习 怎样进入睡前状态
                    - •	将屋内干扰入睡的东西清扫出去。
                    - •	将纸、笔或录音设备放在身边以备记录，并将手机调成飞行模式。
                    - •	将灯光调暗或者戴上眼罩。
                    - •	确保自己处于安静的环境，否则录音笔记录的只能是噪声。
                    - •	别让自己太舒适，比如裸睡或者躺到床上。
                    - •	试着在中午或者吃完午饭后感到有些许困意时进行这项练习。
                    - •	把闹钟调到10～15分钟后。
                    - •	花一点时间，让自己的精力都集中在问题上，然后放松不再做任何思考。
                    - 做一些准备工作将会帮助你更好地进入睡前状态。回忆之前想到的尚未成型的解决方案、问题的大致轮廓和收集到的相关信息，这些将给大脑设定一个思考方向。就好像大脑中设置了一个前台，服务员对你说：“欢迎来到睡前状态，你想要大脑中的天才们讨论什么问题呢？”你必须思考问题，才能解决问题。
                    - 一定要在身边备好纸、笔和录音设备，但不要有其他干扰的东西，从而确保能在第一时间把从睡前状态中获得的灵感记录下来。
                    - 昏暗的灯光也会有帮助。产生突破性灵感时，视觉皮质将会产生阿尔法波，也就是说，大脑将暂停接收视觉信息。昏暗的灯光会减少视觉干扰，有助于大脑产生突破性灵感。
                    - 我们建议你调暗灯光而不是彻底把灯关掉，因为你可能需要灯光来记录。在彻底醒来和记录想法之间，尽量不要设置障碍。同时，你可以尝试戴个眼罩，这样既可以制造昏暗的环境，又可以在要写东西时迅速地把它移走。
                    - 至于是否要有声音则因人而异。有的人喜欢隔绝所有声音，在安静的环境里思考；有的人则倾向于来点白噪声、风扇声、自然声或者低低的电视声。
                    - 研究表明，午饭后小睡一会儿能够增进绝大多数人在当天其余时间的认知能力，并且小睡15～25分钟效果最佳。即使在醒来时并没有产生突破性灵感，午睡也能帮你提高下午的工作效率。(1)
                    - 如果想尝试高科技产品，可以用“睡得香”眼罩（Napwell），这是由麻省理工学院和哈佛医学院的学生开发的眼罩，它能监控你的睡眠情况，帮助你达到最优睡眠效果。如果在深度睡眠的时候被唤醒，你会感到头疼，工作效率也会降低。“睡得香”眼罩会在最合适的时候将你唤醒，甚至能模拟天亮时逐渐变强的光线。
                    - 如果你一时半会儿无法入睡，也不必感到沮丧，因为这种训练会熟能生巧，而且突破性灵感是在我们最放松的时候来临的，而不是在入睡之后。
                - 进入半醒状态，发现解决方案
                    - 要想进入半醒状态，深度睡眠是必需的，所以先整理好枕头，钻进被窝好好睡一觉。半醒状态是从深度睡眠到完全醒来的中间状态。
                    - 深度睡眠一般要几个小时，所以在入睡之前，要做一些准备工作，让大脑处于正确的方向。
                - 突破练习 怎样进入半醒状态
                    - •	看一部你不熟悉的纪录片。听一些陌生的台词或对话，能让你的大脑产生新的神经回路和联想。
                    - •	看看老照片。大脑中的默认网络会从你的记忆深处找到有价值的东西。
                    - •	读一本童年时读过的书。旧的回忆和感受会像潮水一样涌现。
                    - •	出门散散步。这能给大脑补充氧气，也能改变你的睡前惯例，发现更多原来没有的乐趣。
                    - •	设定一个声音逐渐增强的闹钟。不要让自己突然醒过来，用自然界的声音充当闹钟声，效果会更好。
                    - •	身边一定要有一个记录装备，用来写下你的想法或记录下你的声音。从半醒状态中产生的突破性灵感稍纵即逝，如果不立即把它记下来，等醒来后再想找到它可能就很困难了。
                    - 很多创造能手都把自己的成功归功于半醒状态。杰夫·霍金斯（Jeff Hawkins）说：“我经常在半夜时分得到灵感。”他开启了智能手机革命，开发了掌上电脑Palm和智能电话Treo，现在正在研发Grok，一种模拟人类大脑工作流程的人工智能系统。他说：“我在睡觉前会思考一下问题，然后在半夜醒来时静静地躺在床上，在黑暗中继续思索，这样一来答案常常会自己降临。”
                    - 睡觉是我们进入天才模式的一个绝佳途径。朱达在早上醒来时经常会产生一个好点子。他和客户打交道时常说：“好的，我会在明天早上给你答案。”客户们在第二天吃早饭时就会收到朱达的电子邮件，里面有成套的解决方案。奥利维娅和朱达不同，她从未在睡醒时产生新想法。如果她小睡一会儿，醒来时总会觉得有点饿，还有点烦躁。要是她手中拿着小珠子入睡，当珠子滑落把她吵醒时，她会变得很愤怒，心想：“哪个白痴弄出了这么大的噪声？”所以如果睡前状态和半醒状态不适合你，也不要苛责自己。
                - 突破工作坊 如何利用两种状态解决团队问题
                    - 我们曾经成功地运用这个方法帮助一家初创型电子产品设计公司解决了一个棘手的问题。当时，这家公司的设计团队遇到了瓶颈，士气消沉。朱达打开一瓶啤酒想活跃一下气氛，当大家逐渐放松后，奥利维娅尽可能不着痕迹地寻找问题所在。
                    - “我们在想的是，如何在没有架设基站的情况下，用超低频宽建立连接，对吗？”奥利维娅问道。这显然不对，团队成员七嘴八舌地纠正了奥利维娅的说法。最后，大家终于把问题厘清了。
                    - 那天晚上，在大家入睡前，我们把问题用短信发送给了几位团队成员，让他们带着问题入睡。我们扮演了执行网络的角色：确定问题的方向，让他们大脑里的天才开始行动。第二天早上，团队中的一位工程师两眼放光地告诉我们，她在早上醒来时想到了问题的解决方案。
                - 本章小结 突破性灵感来自何处
                
1.	突破性灵感是在执行模式和默认模式的切换时产生的。
                
2.	执行模式帮我们完成事务，由大脑的执行网络控制。执行网络以目标和行动为导向。
                
3.	默认模式是创意和发明的源泉，由大脑的默认网络控制。默认网络在幕后全天候运行。
                
4.	睡前和半醒的时刻是产生突破性灵感的沃土。 
                - 睡前状态，引导默认网络聚焦于解决问题；
                - 半醒状态，帮助我们发现默认网络想出的解决方案。
            - 03 阶段2：孕育蝶蛹 怎样为突破性灵感创造条件
                - 想象你的大脑中正在举行一场聚会：你的想法、记忆、预感、感受和环境线索等都在一起愉快地交谈，时不时邀请新想法参与进来。他们中有些离开大伙儿，要去吧台倒酒，在经过洗手间的路上碰见另一个新想法，于是一边交谈一边愉快地跳着舞。这基本上就是你大脑中天才休息室里正在发生的事情。
                - 这一章将告诉你如何让大脑中产生的想法相互碰撞，进而迸发突破性灵感的火花。
                - 经常走神的人证明，光是休息一下，并不会产生灵感。我们需要完成相应的任务，让大脑进入漫游状态，才能产生灵感。
                - 在一项创造力测试中，实验人员让接受测试的学生回答一个问题：你能用一个挂钩做多少事情？接着，受试者被分成4组，第一组学生先休息12分钟，第二组学生被要求完成一些简单的、不费脑力的任务，第三组学生被要求做一个需要高度使用记忆力的游戏，第四组学生则被要求不能休息。
                - 最后，学生们再来回答一次之前提出的问题。结果显示，第二组学生提出方案的平均数量比之前高出了41%，而其他三组没有明显的改进。
                - 不过，这种进步的前提是学生们提前知道了问题。也就是说，仅仅做简单、不费脑力的游戏并不能提高创意解决问题的能力。这很正常，因为执行网络必须给默认网络，也就是大脑中的那群天才设定一个明确的目标，后者才能发挥效能。
                - 加入不费脑力的活动，提高创意灵感的产出
                    - 让我们举个例子。你正在努力完成一份报告，却感觉报告里面缺少了某些东西，但又说不出到底是什么。你可以盯着墙发发呆，也可以查看电子邮件或者回复一个朋友的未接来电。你也可以做一些简单的事情，让执行网络漫游，比如浇浇花、出门散散步或者做个三明治。这些事情都有可能让你获得突破。
                    - 当执行网络“分心”去做低压力的活动时，我们的天才休息室才能获得更多的脑力支持。
                    - 创造力领域的研究者建议，把不费脑力的活动纳入日常工作，例如那些在认知和执行方面都没有难度的事情，这会成为提高创意产出的重要一环。研究表明，对长期超负荷工作的专业人才来说，交叉安排认知难度不同的工作，有助于提高他们的创造力。
                - 突破练习 进行不费脑力的活动
                    - •	猜谜语或走迷宫；
                    - •	看一部已经看过好多次的电影；
                    - •	对着墙扔皮球；
                    - •	观察树荫下的光影；
                    - •	向窗外看；
                    - •	跑步；
                    - •	洗碗；
                    - •	玩电子游戏；
                    - •	叠衣服；
                    - •	清理屋内一个比较乱的角落；
                    - •	画画、涂鸦或者给图画书上色；
                    - •	做一顿拿手的饭菜。
                    - 你也可以听音乐，如果你会某种乐器的话，那就尽情演奏吧！但一定要选一首熟悉的歌曲，这样才能让大脑放松。音乐是让大脑进入天才模式的灵丹妙药，伴随着熟悉的音乐，你将忘却手头的工作。
                    - 如果我们不是音乐家，戴上耳机安静地聆听音乐就可以让大脑打开回路。你可以坐在沙发上听，躺在地板上听，甚至跑步时听，任何音乐都行，但不要有歌词。即使你对歌词倒背如流，也会给大脑的执行网络传递信息，从而激活它。
                    - 每当你感到困惑、没有头绪、很沮丧时，就请离开办公桌，做做我们推荐的活动吧！上面的任何一项活动都能让你的执行网络离开前台暂时休息，让默认网络里的天才们开始工作。
                    - 你可以试试去报刊亭买份报纸，或者打开电脑浏览一本之前没有阅读过的杂志，抑或访问一个之前没有浏览过的网站。如果你经常读《高尔夫文摘》（Golf Digest），那就看看有关编织或建筑学的杂志；如果你之前喜欢读时尚杂志，那么就选本《福布斯》（Forbes）。获取一些与你面前的挑战无关的信息后，你会吃惊地发现，灵感源源不断地涌入脑海，并会像雪球一样越滚越大。
                    - 奥利维娅有时会盯着家里的扫地机器人出神，试着预测它的前进轨迹。但此时，她能感觉到自己的脑海深处的天才们正在跃跃欲试。虽然盯着扫地机器人发呆有些浪费时间，但这对形成突破性灵感大有益处。
                - 突破工作坊 走出迷宫，做出正确决策
                    - 有时候，从执行模式中切换出来并不是一件容易的事。
                    - 塞丽娜是一名从事公益事业的企业家，致力于消灭非洲的尘肺病。她有很强的事业心，一直在考虑可否把全部时间都花在事业上。但她是不是应该花些时间，找个好男人一起组建家庭呢？她周围的每个人，包括她的妈妈、同事甚至投资人都问过她这个问题。她常常扪心自问，备感焦虑。
                    - 朱达明白，要想得到答案，需要让塞丽娜切换到默认模式，让她大脑里的天才们行动起来。但是，对塞丽娜这样目标性很强的人来说，关闭执行模式并不是一件容易的事。朱达需要给塞丽娜提供一项容易完成的任务，让她的执行网络有活儿干，但又不需要消耗太多的脑力，从而能有多余的脑力用来支持天才们工作。
                    - 在我们见面的地方，有一个简单的石头迷宫。其实这个迷宫只有一条路可走，只需沿着墙走下去，就能抵达中心点。这条路径足以让大脑的执行网络专注，而剩下的能量足够让天才们开展工作。
                    - 朱达让塞丽娜去走走那个迷宫。在进入迷宫前，他向塞丽娜提了一个问题：“如果把所有时间都用在工作上，你是否会感到不快乐，是否会感觉生活中缺少了什么东西？”然后要求她：“在走迷宫的时候，要走得慢一点，不要着急。”最后，当塞丽娜来到了迷宫中央时，她肩膀放松，眉头舒展。她说：“把一生贡献给事业，我感到很快乐。有问题的是别人，不是我。”
                    - 后来，朱达问塞丽娜，她是如何想清楚这个问题的。塞丽娜说，她也不知道发生了什么，只是在走迷宫时，想着这个迷宫的道路到底还剩多少个弯。然后，她感觉自己走了个神。就这样，答案在她心中冒了出来。塞丽娜获得了一个尤里卡突破。
                    - 回到公司后，塞丽娜不再犹豫和彷徨，全身心地把精力投入到了事业中。她希望能够通过自己的努力，让世界变得更美好。
                    - 让大脑进入天才模式最有趣的方法就是，观察一件正在发生的事情。在纽约现代艺术博物馆，人们能看到一个由麻省理工学院建立的模型，它能让人们看到纽约与外界实时的通信画面。试着想一下：在一个深色的地球上，一道道光线从纽约发出，射向世界各地，这些光线代表纽约人打出来的电话。你可以清楚地看到此刻发生的事情，很神奇，是不是？
                    - 现在，再想象一下，如果这个模型展示的是一年前的情况，那你的兴趣可能会大大降低。所以，那些实时发生的事情会吸引大脑执行网络的注意力，同时让默认网络自由漫步。
                    - “最好的、不费脑力的活动是什么？”我们的客户经常提出这个问题。最简单明确的答案就是：如果不得不选择一项活动，那就是散步。
                - 散步，产生突破性灵感的最佳活动
                    - 一项实验结果表明，不论是在室外呼吸着新鲜空气散步，还是在室内跑步机上对着空白的墙壁走路，都能让人们产生比静坐不动时多两倍的创意。
                    - 这项实验的首席研究员表示：“开始时我认为，只有去室外散步才有效果，没想到在跑步机上走路竟然也收效显著。”这项研究还发现，即使在散步结束后坐下来，创意还会持续涌现。“我们知道‘走路会议’能够激发创造力，但是在会议开始前散步也可能有同样的效果。”
                    - 从认知学的角度来说，步行需要执行网络投入一定的专注力，而又不至于牵扯太多。其实，步行是一项复杂的任务，我们需要协调双脚迈步的节奏、呼吸的频率和胳膊的摆动等，当然负责平衡的内耳也一直在工作。但我们的大脑是执行这项任务的专家。通过长时间熟悉步行的过程，执行网络会对此感到毫不费力。
                    - 从生理学的角度来说，步行能激发大脑的活力。血流量的增加能引发一系列奇妙的脑部变化，包括分泌出脑源性神经营养因子（BDNF）和其他生长因子。它们能促进新神经元的产生和新突触的形成，还能强化现有的突触。
                    - 人们对于开放式办公空间的理念褒贬不一，但有一点毋庸置疑，开放式办公空间的墙和桌子更少，更有利于走动。斯坦福大学的一项研究表明，开放式办公空间对创造力最重要的贡献就是，方便大家经常走动，这样做会让人们的创意产出增加60%。
                    - 达尔文家门口有一条著名的400米长的“沙路”，这是他边走路边思考的地方。散步对于达尔文思考问题太重要了，因此他有时甚至会用解决问题时走过沙路的圈数为问题命名。
                    - 梅森·柯里（Mason Currey）研究了近200位世界上最多产的发明家和创意天才，他发现他们唯一的共同爱好就是散步。柯里提到，查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickens）每天下午散步3个小时，他的写作灵感就来源于散步时所观察到的情景。
                    - 柴可夫斯基（Tchaikovsky）每天要花两个小时散步，而且一分钟都不能少。他认为，如果每天散步的时间不够两个小时，自己就会生病。贝多芬每天午饭后都要散会儿步，并且随身带着一支铅笔和一张纸以便随时记下灵感。
                    - 索伦·克尔恺郭尔（Soren Kierkegaard，丹麦哲学家）曾说过：“我的灵感都是在走路时获得的。”有好几次，他都是匆匆地跑回书桌前，奋笔疾书，头上还戴着散步时的帽子，另一只手还握着拐杖或雨伞。
                    - 每天的同一时刻，康德都会去小镇广场散步。
                    - 海森堡也曾经在书中写道，在研究量子力学那些晦涩的问题时，他每天晚上都会和玻尔展开漫长的讨论，结果往往是“陷入让人绝望的死胡同”。每次讨论完，海森堡都会去街区的公园转一转，问问自己：“大自然真的如同实验结果那样不合情理吗？”海森堡就是在从街心公园走回家的路上，想出了20世纪物理学界最重要的定理之一：不确定性原理。这就是典型的思维漫游。
                    - 安静地散步是让思维漫游的最佳时机。如果走在大街上，你必须时刻关注来往的汽车、行人和红绿灯等干扰信息，效果就会差很多，因为我们大脑的执行网络在这种情况下必须时刻保持工作状态。至于散步时是否需要设定方向和路线，这完全可以由你决定。朱达喜欢无目的地闲逛，而奥利维娅则喜欢在散步前预先设定好路线。
                    - 有一点要明确：你不会只是散了一次步，就能奇迹般获得突破性灵感。散步只是创造了条件，要想产生突破性灵感，还需要做许多事情。
                - 突破练习 创意散步
                    - •	首先要明确问题所在。把遇到的问题搞清楚，是寻找答案的第一步。
                    - •	审查原材料。阅读你收集的最新信息，检查一下之前所做的笔记。
                    - •	设定目标。你散步的目的是要解决某个困惑，还是仅仅放松一下？
                    - •	留意周围。你可以稍稍走神，但不要完全忽略沿途的景色。
                    - •	带上笔记本。一定要确保可以随时把自己的想法记录下来。
                    - •	手里拿一个东西。硬币、石子、纸夹或者《星球大战》（Star Wars）的卡通小人都可以。我们的手会传给大脑很多信息并激发大脑的思考。亚当·齐亚就经常一边把玩着魔方，一边思考问题。
                    - •	及时停下来记录灵感。不要仅仅享受获得灵感的喜悦，而让灵感只在脑海中闪现。世界上没有什么事比忘记一个好主意更令人痛苦的了。
                - 改变环境，激发突破性灵感
                    - 天才的办公桌都乱成一团，这种刻板印象的存在是有道理的：创意模式混乱无序，而无序有助于创意。事实上，这种混乱有时是必须的，就像我们喜欢的一位合作者所说的：“混乱是必要的。”
                    - 与用排列整齐的乐高积木搭造房子相比，从一堆混乱的乐高积木中选择积木搭建出绝妙的建筑是否会让你觉得更好玩？在玩积木时，我们都有一种想先把积木弄乱，然后再从中选择材料搭建积木的冲动。事实上，整齐有序有利于提高产量，却不利于激发创造力。
                    - 有位发明家的家里有两个工作室，一个整洁有序，而另一个乱成一团，后者就是用来激发他的创造力的。同样，许多高科技公司为他们的员工准备了活动室，里面甚至还有一些大人玩的玩具。你应该寻求可控的混乱，它能激发创造力，但不妨碍生产力。
                    - 一位年轻的创意天才告诉我们，他会定期把屋子里所有的东西弄乱，然后再把它们摆放整齐，过几天再弄乱，再摆放整齐……虽然这快把他的室友逼疯了。
                - 突破练习 改变你的所处环境
                    - •	摆放棱镜，结合光线、色彩和移动运转带来的刺激效果。
                    - •	把大自然的元素搬到你的创意空间里，比如植物、岩石或一个小喷泉等。
                    - •	爬树。是的，我们没开玩笑。你可能很长时间没有做过这件事了，而这正是应该爬树的原因。从一个奇怪的角度看世界能帮我们打开新的视角。
                    - •	如果你住在城市，就到高层建筑的顶楼四处眺望。如果你所处的建筑的公共空间有窗户，那就走到窗前向外看。你也可以去同事的办公室看看不一样的景色。从新的视角凝视窗外，看看有什么不同：街道布置得怎么样？树是什么样子的？有没有河流经过？如果让你设计这个城市，你会怎么做？
                    - 同样，以上建议对你的作用可能不尽相同。你需要找到对你有效的刺激方式。奥利维娅很喜欢坐火车旅行，不断变化的风景给她提供了一些可以凝视的东西，而她的思绪又可以漫游。当思路陷入困境时，她既能接收新刺激又不至于分心。另外，身为乘客，她处于一个被动接受的放松状态，不需要采取什么行动或者承担什么责任，因此更容易让思绪自由游荡。
                    - 有人在坐飞机时会产生好点子，有人是在洗澡时，还有人是在做园艺、跑步甚至静坐时获得灵感。有人习惯于通过画画捕捉灵感，有人是在看电影、随意阅读甚至做饭时获得灵感。有人喜欢看街景、海洋或走进森林，有人愿意去沙滩漫步，有人则喜欢背靠大树坐一会儿。
                    - 重要的是，辨识出自己容易获得突破性灵感的环境，并让自己经常置身于其中。
                - 突破工作坊 找出适合自己的方式
                    - 我们常认为，静坐或做一个像跑步那样的重复性动作是获得突破性灵感的关键，其实未必。坚是一个营销公司的高级副总裁，他的公司准备在日本开展一次有难度的营销活动。坚浑身充满能量，说话快，走路更快，他的“快节奏”让他的整个团队都处于一种焦虑状态。
                    - 我们很清楚，要想让坚凝视窗外或者在树下静坐，这不太可能。我们了解到，坚从小就喜欢打棒球，他以前甚至想成为一名日本职业棒球运动员。
                    - 有一天，我们把坚的整个团队带到街心公园。奥利维娅带着团队中的其他成员来到公园的一角，这里树荫环绕，很适合人们静坐休息。朱达则和坚待在一起。朱达拿出了一个弹力球，这种弹力球是用硬橡胶做的，上面有8个凸起的点，用来训练棒球运动员的灵敏度，如果把它扔到地上，它将会不规则地弹起来，仿佛随意蹦跳的棒球。
                    - 朱达站在距离坚15米远的地方开始向他扔弹力球，而坚像一个职业棒球运动员那样摆好姿势，准备接球，他的脸上也露出了微笑。他时而接到好球，时而接不到球甚至被球击中身体。
                    - 像这种激烈的运动一般不会激发我们的天才模式，但是因为坚精力太充沛了，这个方法居然奏效了。玩了一会儿后，坚停了下来，抬头说：“我知道该怎么办了。”
                    - 由此可见，激发突破性灵感并没有什么固定的方法和模式，你需要找到适合自己的方式。
                - 突破练习 把玩周边的环境
                    - •	现在，在自己周围找到5种你最喜欢的颜色。
                    - •	摸一摸周围的东西，直到找到5种你最喜欢的材质。
                    - •	做出5种不同的手势。做吧，用自己的手摆出不同的姿势。
                    - 你所处的环境，不单是指看得到的事物，也包括你听到的声音。以下是两种针对听觉环境的练习。
                    - 1．将听到的音乐可视化：在你欣赏古典音乐时，请想象一个与此有关的故事。这段音乐描述的是年轻的主人公离开家乡的小村庄，在冒险的途中遇到海盗、少女和海怪的故事吗？还是在表达一位老人的丧妻之痛？迪士尼电影《幻想曲》（Fantasia）就是这样写出来的。
                    - 2．改变电影配乐：朱达最喜欢这种方法，它来自俄罗斯电影大师谢尔盖·爱森斯坦（Sergei Eisenstein）的经典电影特技。在看一部电影时，关掉声音，同时播放一段音乐。十有八九，新的音乐能和电影情节完美结合。有一次，在我们和基因泰克制药公司的研发团队开会的间隙，一位高管建议把皇后乐队的《我们是冠军》（We Are the Champions）和电影《卡萨布兰卡》（Casablanca）的最后一幕结合起来。这引发了研究团队的大讨论：是否可以把艺术家和音乐家与研究人员组合起来，帮助研究人员想象关键分子的化学结构，以改善用药。
                - 突破练习 激发突破性灵感的最佳背景音
                    - •	有一款叫作“咖啡动力”（Coffitivity）的应用程序，能够产生咖啡店里的背景声。这款应用的开发者起初想测试背景音对于工作效率的影响。
                    - •	如果你一直在做重复性的工作，听双声道音乐也许会对你有所帮助。从左、右耳机听到不同的音乐频率，能帮你度过枯燥期。
                    - •	尝试听听电子乐，这类音乐通常用重复的基本旋律来“叙事”。
                    - •	火车行驶时“哐当哐当”的声音或洗衣机里搅动的声音，这些声音出奇地让人感到舒缓。网上有很多这种音乐素材。
                    - •	有的网站上有各种环境声，你也可以把它们混合起来，比如雨声和雷声、潮水声和风声或者潮水声和雨声。
                    - 如果你想获得对一个问题的新洞察，也可以试试改变自己所处的社会环境。你可以通过接触不同民族、不同年龄和社会阶层的人来寻找新的视角。这也是旅行能够提供灵感的原因：你全身心地沉浸在新鲜事物中。旅行能为我们营造不同的外在环境、听觉环境和社会环境等。
                    - 多参与社交活动会成倍增加我们的联想力。每个人的思维都会在不同的记忆和事实之间跳跃，努力为随机发生的事情寻找某种联系。通过与他人分享，你将会产生全新的联想。
                    - 此外，突破性灵感往往最常出现在你独处时：当其他人在场时，你很难把大部分脑力投入给天才们。独处与社交的最佳时间分配因人而异，你需要找到适合自己的那个比例。
                    - 爱因斯坦把在海滩上的散步看得十分重要，他认为这样“才可以倾听内心的声音”。许多伟人都认为独处是很有必要的。莫扎特曾经说过，只有完全独处的时候才是他灵感涌现的时刻，或许是在马车上、餐后散步时，或许是在夜里睡不着的时候。
                    - 尼古拉·特斯拉是交流电的发明者，他曾说：“人在独处时，大脑会更加敏锐和专注……独处是发明的秘诀，灵感会油然而生。”
                    - 最好的环境改变可能是你心理状态的变化：把自己想象成其他人或者其他东西。
                    - 一些前沿技术，如“身体共鸣”技术（bodily resonance），可以模拟这种体验。在一项有趣的研究中，研究人员运用“橡胶手错觉”来创造更强烈的认同感。通过各种传感器白种人受试者感到自己有一只深肤色的手，当这种感觉越强烈时，他们对另一个种族的认同感越高。通过增强感受，研究人员得以改变受试者的心态。
                    - 橡胶手错觉还能发展得更远，你甚至可以“变成”一个物体。比如可以“变成”一把勺子，在它产生同理心后，当研究人员用锤子敲击勺子时，你甚至会产生了反射性畏缩。
                - 突破练习 改变你的心理环境
                    - •	题材随机的纪录片随便看一部。试着把这部纪录片的内容和你目前所做的工作联系起来。比如，如果纪录片介绍了在肯塔基州生产的波本酒的种类，那么它和你目前正在准备的口红营销项目有什么联系呢？
                    - •	找一天，试着把自己打扮成别人。如果你以前的穿衣风格很休闲，那就试着穿上正装。如果你每天都穿西服上班，那就试着穿无袖衬衣和短裤。如果你知道自己在别人眼中的形象会有所不同，那么你自己就会感觉不一样。我们的衣着其实与我们的心理环境有关。多个研究表明，如果让参与者穿上医生的白大褂，他们的自信和专注度都会大大增加。
                    - •	在接下来的20分钟里，尝试去做出现在你脑海中的第一件事。这比想象的要难，对吧？在决定做某事前，我们总会找各种理由去反对和阻止自己。
                - 创造性设定限制
                    - 创造性限制同样能够激发我们的创造力。关于创造性限制，有一个广为流传但真实性可疑的例子，说的是作家海明威（Ernest Hemingway）和朋友打赌，他能用6个字写出一篇小说。
                    - 6个字怎么能够介绍人物，解释人物关系，讲述故事，唤起读者的情绪呢？但海明威做到了：
                    - 出售：童鞋，未穿。
                    - For sale: baby shoes, never worn.
                    - 当初，史蒂夫·乔布斯告诉第一个苹果鼠标的设计师，要实现舒适的单手操作，并且可以在包括牛仔裤在内的任何表面上操作，售价还要低于15美元。这些要求就是设定创造性限制。
                    - 你也可以为自己设定创造性限制，比如完成某项任务的截止日期。对有些人来说，设定截止日期能逼迫自己产生更强的动力，而对很多人来说，他们不得不这样做，因为有无数的工作会占用所有时间，所以截止日期有助于他们集中注意力。凯文·索尔（Kevin Sauer）是微软黑带团队的工程师，他说：
                    - 在软件行业，我们会用迭代或冲刺的方式，在任何给定的时间内，聚焦于手上的工作。以我的经验来看，如果设定的时间较短（比如一周），我们的团队就能高度地集中注意力，在这段时间里完成的工作量有时会比两周甚至一个月所能完成的还要大。因为一周的时间实在太短了，所以我们不会去追求完美，也就不会害怕失败。
                    - 那么，该怎样使用创造性限制呢？我们可以设定一个有限的时间、有限的空间或者有限的资源，比如物料或资金。
                    - 创意专家蒂娜·齐莉格（Tina Seelig）是斯坦福大学设计学院著名的教授，也是我们的好朋友。她曾经在学院里开设了一个为期一周的课程，帮助学生理解商业思维的主要原则。她发给每位学生一个信封，里面装着一笔启动资金。她告诉学生，他们有四五天的时间来规划，但是一旦打开信封，他们就只有两个小时的时间来用启动资金赚更多的钱。
                    - 学生们打开信封后，发现里面只有5美元。齐莉格解释说，赚钱最多的那个组可能连这5美元都用不到，因为他们会意识到，5美元对这个课题有太多的限制。
                    - 有一组队员在学校的学生会门前摆了个摊，他们为自行车免费测量胎压，如果需要打气，就收一美元打气费。一个小时后，他们发现，人们对他们的行为很感激，于是不再只收一美元，而是接受捐款，让人们按照自己的能力给他们付费。人们付给他们的钱往往比一美元要多。最后，他们一共收了几百美元。还有一组队员，他们在帕洛阿尔托市附近的著名饭店里预订了很多座位，到了晚餐时间，他们再把这些预订的座位出售出去。
                    - 但赚钱最多的，是销售课堂“演讲时间”的团队。根据齐莉格的要求，每个组都有3分钟的时间向全班展示自己的赚钱过程。这个组把这3分钟卖给了一家想要招聘斯坦福学生的公司。他们意识到，演讲时间是他们所能出售的最宝贵的东西。这个例子告诉我们，有时我们所看到的“限制条件”可能并不存在。
                    - 导演弗朗西斯·福特·科波拉（Francis Ford Coppola）在拍摄电影《现代启示录》（Apocalypse Now）时，希望剧中主角马龙·白兰度（Marlon Brando）能够苗条一些，这样能更好地展示他所扮演的库尔茨上校（Colonel Kurtz）。但是，白兰度最后仍然超重。所以科波拉在拍摄白兰度的镜头时，只能尽量把他拍摄在阴影里，观众几乎看不到白兰度的正面形象。虽然这样做是为了掩盖白兰度超重的事实，却起到了意想不到的效果，库尔兹上校的形象变得更加令人恐惧。这被誉为导演最明智的决定。
                    - 齐莉格还列举了电影《巨蟒与圣杯》（Monty Python and the Holy Grail）中的例子，在电影中，骑士们并没有骑马，因为当时的制作经费有限，剧组租不起马。于是演员们假装骑马穿越森林，他们的仆人们则用两个椰子壳敲出马蹄声。这成了电影中最有趣和最令人难忘的情景之一。
                    - 尝试设定各种限制条件，是“设计思维”的一部分。这是斯坦福大学设计学院教导学生的一种迭代方法，从此用来解决问题、创造更美好的未来。针对这种思维方式，我们可以再写一本书来探讨。
                - 本章小结 怎样为突破性灵感创造条件
                    
1.	要获得突破性灵感，就要让思维漫游。
                    
2.	研究表明，在认知强度不同的工作间切换，可以提高创造力。
                    
3.	散步是提升创造力的最佳活动之一。散步时，你需要做一些其他的事来营造有助于创意产生的条件，并在途中记录好你的灵感。
                    
4.	改变环境能激发突破性灵感。这种改变可以是你的所处环境、听觉环境、社会环境或心理环境。
                    
5.	设定限制有助于产生突破性灵感。这些限制可以是经济上的，也可以是时间上的。相对地，把一些限制条件撤除也会产生意想不到的效果。
            - 04 阶段3：羽化成蝶 突破性灵感是如何产生的
                - “创意不过是把一些东西连接起来。所以，你问创意天才是如何做出不同凡响的作品时，他们会有些不好意思，因为他们觉得自己并没有做什么，只是看出来了……因为他们能把自己过去的体验连接起来，合成新事物。”
                - 乔布斯这段话说的是“联想思维”，它是突破性灵感的重要组成部分。很多时候，我们误以为突破性灵感都是独立产生的，从未有人想到过。而事实上，几乎所有的突破性灵感都是由现有的观点组合而成的。
                - 亨利·福特（Henry Ford）把芝加哥肉类加工行业使用的机械化挂钩和面包店的输送带联想在一起，得到了突破性灵感，并将其应用到了汽车领域。制造业生产流水线由此诞生。
                - 联想思维，产生突破性灵感的关键
                    - 枪支射击精度的突破性提升源于制造商对弓和箭的仔细观察。箭末端的羽毛能让它在空气中不断旋转，旋转使箭飞得笔直。同理，当你以旋球方式踢出足球时，足球也会飞得笔直。为了让子弹旋转射出，枪支制造商设计出了带有螺旋轨迹的枪管，枪支射击精度因此提高了5倍。因为在箭尾插羽毛叫“rifling”，所以这些枪也叫“rifle”，也就是来复枪。
                    - 有一天，法国医生勒内·雷纳克（René Laennec）看到两个孩子正在做游戏，一个孩子在长空心木棍的前端用别针刮蹭，另一个孩子把耳朵贴在长木棍的末端听。雷纳克发现，这根木棍能放大声音，由此产生了灵感，发明了听诊器。
                    - 帕克（T. J. Parker）在无聊时的一些小举动帮他创立了PillPack公司，引发了整个医药行业的革命。
                    - 2006年，沃尔特里德陆军医疗中心发布的一项研究显示，病人养成正确服药习惯的关键是，单次使用的药物都放在一个吸塑包装袋里。这一方法可将处方药的正确服用率从61%提升到96%。但研究同时指出，生产包装袋太耗时，难以扩大规模。
                    - 这一发现非常重要，因为一项针对心血管患者的研究报告表明，近一半的患者因服药不当而住院。这样的失误造成了美国每年数以百万甚至千万的医疗支出。如果有人能找出批量生产这种包装的方法，就能在保证病人健康的同时节省巨额的医疗费用。
                    - 帕克进入了这个领域。2013年，他和埃利奥特·科恩（Elliot Cohen）共同创立了PillPack公司，专门生产能集中放置单次服用剂量的药物的包装袋，并在标签上标注日期和时间。帕克是怎么做到的呢？
                    - 最重要的一点是，帕克出身于制药世家。他之所以听闻这份研究报告，是因为他的父亲是一名药剂师，专门为疗养院的病人分装药物。
                    - 帕克还在医学院学习过，并且选修了工业设计、家具设计、建筑学、纺织学和服装设计的课程。他告诉我们：“当时，我学设计是因为无聊。因为无聊想消磨时间做的那些事，就是你真正感兴趣而且会变得擅长的事。”他还是麻省理工学院创业大赛的志愿者，并涉猎科技领域。
                    - 基于药理、运营、技术和设计相关方面的知识，帕克创建了自动分药系统，由机器人处理从分拣药丸到定制包装的工作。PillPack公司的创新构想或许有部分归功于帕克从医学院学到的知识，但很多和他有着同样学位的人却没能做出这样创新的尝试。
                    - 爱迪生最“失败”的发明之一应该是用于复制文档的气动钢笔了。他在1876年申请专利后，这种笔并没有得到广泛的应用。直到1891年，塞缪尔·奥赖利（Samuel O’ Reilly）发现了这种笔并产生了一个突破性灵感。他究竟想到了什么？
                    - 第一条线索是：除了爱迪生发明的作用以外，这支气动钢笔还会在什么情况下派上用场呢？笔除了在纸上写东西以外，还可以在别的什么地方写吗？
                    - 第二条线索是：笔的本质是什么？我们通常认为笔是一种在纸上书写语言的工具。但实际上，笔的本质是把墨水印在物体表面。印上去的当然不只是语言，那么，气动钢笔还能在什么物体的表面留下什么样的痕迹呢？
                    - 坐下来想想最后这个问题，你想到了什么？试着列出不同的印迹和不同表面的清单，即使猜错了，这也是一个很棒的练习。
                    - 这里还有另一个提示。除了考虑气动钢笔，还可以考虑一下塞缪尔·奥赖利的情况。19世纪末，他在纽约市区工作，那个地方鱼龙混杂：街上的醉汉横七竖八，酒馆林立，装满牡蛎的车沿街叫卖，刚从布鲁克林海军船上走下来的水手拥挤地走在河对岸的街道上。这些帮你想到了什么吗？
                    - 塞缪尔·奥赖利是一个文身艺术家，他用爱迪生的气动钢笔发明了现代文身机。除了在纸上书写外，塞缪尔·奥赖利用墨水在皮肤上绘出了美丽的图案。
                    - 一百多年后，设计学院的学生皮埃尔·埃姆（Pierre Emm）也做了一个类似的创新。法国文化部鼓励学生在公共领域创建混搭艺术。有一天，皮埃尔·埃姆骑着自行车在街上闲逛，他突然想到，可以用3D打印机来文身。
                    - 20世纪70年代，加利福尼亚州南部遭遇了一场严重的干旱，游泳池里滴水不剩。当时的滑板爱好者们把没水的游泳池当成了滑板运动场，后来发展出现在几乎每个城市都能看到的凹形滑板运动场。
                    - 1963年，滑板运动员汤姆·西姆斯（Tom Sims）想把他最喜欢的滑雪和滑板运动结合起来，在冬季也玩滑板。因此，在七年级木工课上，他动手做了一个滑雪板，这种运动方式就是今天单板滑雪的雏形。
                - 7个基本创新问题：产生新联想的高效工具
                    - 我们要介绍一个可以帮你产生联想的工具：7个基本创新问题，它将给你大脑的执行网络设定一个目标。执行网络喜欢有个目标，当忙于达成目标时，会让默认功能区的天才们全力工作。
                    - 欧特克公司（Autodesk）是7个基本创新问题的发明者。欧特克是世界领先的3D设计软件企业，业务涵盖娱乐、建筑和工业设计等多个领域。欧特克公司的大厅陈列着很多运用3D打印技术创造的作品，包括服饰、珠宝、珊瑚礁、一辆功能齐全的摩托车和全尺寸的飞机引擎。欧特克了解创新的真谛。
                    - 这7个具有指导意义的问题是欧特克创新策略师比尔·奥康纳（Bill O’Connor）带领团队取得突破的关键。这些问题可以帮助人们预见一个丰硕的结果，并能从不同的视角发现创新的可能性。
                    - 当然，这些问题并不能保证一定会产出突破性灵感或特定结果，但它们提供了产生突破性灵感的高效思考框架，为“蝴蝶”的出现创造了理想的环境。
                    - 奥康纳提到，我们都具有想象、观察、移动、使用、互连、改变和创造事物的全部能力，只是我们还没有把这些能力系统地呈现出来。这7个基本问题就是一份检查清单。“这不是头脑风暴，”他告诉我们，“这是头脑串流。”
                    - 无论你的目标是什么，无论你现在具备哪些条件，你都可以从7个不同的角度来检视它们。当然，并不是每一个角度都能奏效，但你可以从其中一个方向发现创新的可能。
                    - 这7个基本创新问题的关键词是观察（Look）、使用（Use）、移动（Move）、互连（Interconnect）、改变（Alter）、创造（Make）、想象（Imagine），首字母缩写拼起来就是LUMIAMI。
                        1. 观察：可以从哪些全新的视角观察这个问题？
                        2. 使用：我们可以使用哪些全新的方式来利用这个问题的各个方面？
                        3. 移动：如果移动问题所处的时间或空间，会发生什么？
                        4. 互连：我们是否可以创建新的连接或者改变现有的连接方式？
                        5. 改变：在设计和性能方面，我们可以改变些什么？
                        6. 创造：我们可以创造哪些全新的事物？
                        7. 想象：我们可以想象创造一种怎样的超棒体验？
                    - 这7个基本创新问题都有单独的对照清单。它们主要针对有形的突破，对于涉及无形产品的创新，我们标注了*号。几乎每个问题都将挑战你现有的认知。
                        - 1．观察
                            - 提高视角：从10 000米高空重新看待问题。
                            - 切换视角：从另一个方向观察事物，比如从后面、侧面。
                            - 评估价值：从价值观的角度看待一样东西。
                            - 孩子视角：想像一下，孩子会如何看待这个东西。
                            - 忽略事实：像看待一个全新的事物一样观察一个你熟悉的东西。
                            - 整体视角：从系统和整体的角度看待问题。
                            - 爱因斯坦在仰望星空时说，不管你跑得多快，光总是以每秒300 000千米的速度冲向你。说这话时，他就是撇开了原来的经验。
                        - 2．使用
                            - 利用杠杆：以此为杠杆可以翘起什么东西？
                            - 确定基础：能用现有的东西为什么事情打下基础？
                            - 自由替代：能用现有的东西代替别的什么吗？
                            - 转换层面：能从什么样的新角度思考任务？

                    - 这7个基本创新问题贯穿了形成突破性灵感的整个过程，思考这些问题本身就是具有创造性的。同时，正如奥康纳所言，他们在使用中也经常会漏掉一些问题和步骤，因此需要这份清单备忘。这些问题能帮助个人和团队用创新方法应对挑战。
                    - 你可以从另一个角度看待问题，可以重新定义概念，可以删减或修正一些元素，可以增减做一件事的频率，也可以重新设计体验、外观和感受。
                    - 在思考这些问题的时候，不要给自己设置任何障碍，而是单纯地看待事物本身，去思考如何将它与别的事物连接，如何做出改进和创新，大胆假设所有你能想到的东西。这个过程将使你脑洞大开，迈进创新的大门。
                - 模式识别，发现相似性，找到突破
                    - 在实验精神鼎盛的20世纪70年代初，印第安纳大学规定，只要有教务处和院长的批准，任何学生都可以讲授一门有学分的课程。
                    - 迈克尔·尤斯兰（Michael Uslan）从小就爱看漫画书，他想教一门关于漫画书的课。他的想法得到了民俗系的热烈支持，接下来的任务就是说服院长，但这并不容易。见面几分钟后，院长就打断了他：“停下吧，我不认可你的课程。我在小时候就读过每一本《超人》（Superman）故事，但那些不过是哄小孩子的把戏而已。”
                    - 尤斯兰请院长从一个孩子的角度讲一下超人的故事。
                    - “没问题，”院长回应道，“氪星即将毁灭，一位科学家和他的妻子把他们尚在襁褓中的小儿子放进飞船送到地球。地球上的肯特夫妇发现了这个孩子，把他养大并视如己出……”说到这里，院长突然停下来，盯着尤斯兰看了一会。之后，尤斯兰的开课申请就通过了。
                    - 尽管当尤斯兰买下蝙蝠侠的电影版权时，超级英雄电影还带有“孩子气、书呆子、类似龙与黑暗城堡”的标签，但现在人们已很难记清有哪个超级英雄没被拍成卖座电影。从1989年蒂姆·伯顿（Tim Burton）执导的《蝙蝠侠》（Batman）开始，所有现代蝙蝠侠系列电影的制片人都是尤斯兰，他正是现代超级英雄电影时代的开创者。
                    - 在模式识别中，人们会把两个概念联系在一起，寻找它们深层的相似之处。院长在看到超人故事与个别励志故事深层的相似之处后，突然就理解了尤斯兰课程的核心点。
                    - 再举一个例子，以下是迪士尼电影《风中奇缘》（Pocahontas）的故事梗概。
                    - 1607年，约翰·史密斯乘坐一艘小船抵达北美洲郁郁葱葱的新世界，那里的殖民者在总督拉特克利夫的监督下开采黄金。约翰·史密斯开始探索新的领域，并遇到了波卡洪塔斯。最初她并不信任他，但柳树婆婆的一句话让她打消了戒心。
                    - 他们俩开始一起做很多事情，波卡洪塔斯告诉约翰丛林里每个生命的价值，以及自然界是如何形成生态圈的。同时，也教他如何打猎、种庄稼，并讲了很多关于她部落的故事。波卡洪塔斯的父亲是波瓦坦酋长，想把她嫁给高刚，一个优秀而严肃的战士，但是波卡洪塔斯并不喜欢他。
                    - 随着时间的推移，约翰和波卡洪塔斯发现他们爱上了彼此。但是，有些殖民者认为原住民是野蛮人，为了获得黄金，准备攻击村庄，而高刚也因为妒忌想要杀死约翰，但最后反被殖民者杀死了。
                    - 正当殖民者准备对部落发起进攻时，约翰却被部落原住民指责并判处死刑。紧要关头，殖民者赶到了，波瓦坦酋长差点被杀害，约翰被拉特克利夫总督所伤，拉特克利夫随后被殖民军抓起来遣送回英国。波卡洪塔斯冒着生命危险救出了约翰，两人终于走到了一起，两种文化也开始相互接纳。
                    - 后来，有一个细心的影迷马特·贝特曼（Matt Bateman）把剧情稍做修改，变成了詹姆斯·卡梅隆（James Cameron）执导的《阿凡达》（Avatar）的故事。
                    - 16072194年，约翰·史密斯杰克·斯库利乘坐一艘小船太空船抵达北美洲潘多拉星球郁郁葱葱的新世界，那里的殖民者在总督拉特克利夫夸奇上校的监督下开采黄金“无碱”这一罕见的常温超导体。约翰·史密斯杰克·斯库利开始探索新的领域，并遇到了波卡洪塔斯妮特丽。最初她并不信任他，但柳树婆婆生命之树的一句话让她打消了戒心。
                    - 他们俩开始一起做很多事情，波卡洪塔斯妮特丽告诉约翰杰克丛林里每个生命的价值，还有自然界是如何形成生态圈的，同时，也教他如何打猎、种庄稼驯龙，并讲了很多关于她部落的故事。波卡洪塔斯妮特丽的父亲是波瓦坦埃图康酋长，想把她嫁给高刚苏泰，一个优秀而严肃的战士，但是波卡洪塔斯妮特丽并不喜欢他。
                    - 随着时间的推移，约翰杰克和波卡洪塔斯妮特丽发现他们爱上了彼此。但是，有些殖民者认为原住民是野蛮人，为了获得黄金“无碱”，准备攻击村庄，而高刚苏泰也因为妒忌想要杀死约翰·史密斯杰克·斯库利，但最后反被殖民者杀死了。
                    - 正当原住民准备发起进攻时，约翰杰克被部落原住民指责并判处死刑。紧要关头，原住民赶到了，波瓦坦埃图康酋长差点被杀害，约翰杰克被拉特克利夫总督夸奇上校所伤，拉特克利夫夸奇随后被殖民军抓起来遣送回英国中箭。波卡洪塔斯妮特丽冒着生命危险救出了约翰杰克，两人终于走到了一起，两种文化也开始相互接纳。
                    - 请想象一家酒店是如何高品质地满足客户需求的。怎样选择细致入微的员工，怎样随时回应宾客需求、安排便捷入住？这个高级酒店的首席执行官是什么样的人，他如何确保每一位客人都能享受到美妙的入住体验，他如何选择和培训员工？
                    - 然后，再想象一家医院会提供哪些服务？如何保证病人的高满意度？如何减少候诊室的等待时间？如何培训友好的医护人员？在呼叫铃响起时，护士会及时出现吗？
                    - 这两个行业有什么共同之处？答案是，每天都有大量的人流。它们共同的成功要素是什么？有人认为友好亲切的服务态度是关键之一。
                    - 如果医院雇用这家酒店的首席执行官，让他担任院长，并告诉他“要干得更好”，那么这位首席执行官将如何开展工作？他将如何重新选拔和培训员工，将如何借鉴以往最有用的经验？
                    - 你相信吗？上述场景就在现实生活中上演了。2006年，亨利福特西布伦医院（Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital）任命新院长，他此前是豪华酒店丽思卡尔顿的高管，在那里有25年工作经验，但他从未在医院工作过一天。
                    - 他就是杰勒德·范格林斯文（Gerard van Grinsven），上任后非常关注医患关系。他将折叠椅摆进了病房。医生巡房时，会打开椅子坐下与病人交谈，而不像之前那样俯视或者远远地看一眼病人。这个小小的改变营造了医生和病人的互动机会，改善了医患关系。
                    - 范格林斯文在医院开设了向公众开放的健康中心和美发沙龙，这样医院就能同时给病人和家属提供服务，并帮助医院更好地融入社区。他甚至创造了一个快速登记系统来帮助病人简单快速地入院，就像入住酒店一样简单，与此同时，病房已经准备好了。从本质上讲，范格林斯文将酒店行业客户服务的理念带进了医疗行业。
                    - 在他的任期内，亨利福特西布伦医院成为全美公认的最好的一家医院。当他发现了医院和酒店的共同之处后，这个模式实现了百万美元的突破。
                - 突破工作坊 利用模式识别形成价值不菲的突破
                    - 美国陆军特种部队通常会承担复杂、具有政治敏感性的任务。这些特种部队的士兵非常聪明，能够自如应对不确定的环境，并能训练有素地控制他们最原始的情绪，例如恐慌。他们中的许多人受训于陆军的外国军事和文化研究大学，这所学校专门培训红队队员，所以也被称为红队大学。士兵们在退役上校史蒂夫·罗特科夫的监督下学习最前沿的认知工具。在过去的7年中，朱达在这里教授关于限制思考的无意识心理框架的知识。
                    - 有一节课讨论的是一场仍在进行的冲突，课堂的讨论氛围很紧张。几乎所有学员都有朋友在冲突中牺牲，他们谈论的不是地图上抽象的概念或名称，而是当地真实的气味、尘土、山丘、战争和流血。
                    - 那天晚上，朱达和3个士兵出去喝啤酒，他们还在谈论事件可能的结果。对这个小团体来说，这不是闲谈。其中一个士兵来自策划小组，负责预测这场冲突可能的结果以便提前规划，另外两名士兵不久后将被派到中东。第二轮啤酒上来的时候，他们问朱达如何看待这件事情。
                    - 朱达不想做理论性的空谈，而想通过联想来帮助士兵们辨识模式。于是，他打开手机上的维基百科词条，输入了一次欧洲革命的名字，将得到的信息分享给了士兵。
                    - 特种部队士兵立即看到这次革命与上次冲突的相似之处：以城市为中心的反抗力量；互联网和社会媒体的技术转移；经济不平等；年轻人、自由主义者和工人组成的不稳定联盟。
                    - 一个士兵含蓄地说：“谢谢你，先生。我们知道如何继续工作了。”历史的经验帮助士兵们制订了一个更有效的计划。他们不再争论可能发生的事情，而是预测了最有可能发生的事情。他们的预测在伊朗、巴林、埃及都得到了验证。
                - 本章小结 如何产生突破性灵感
                    - 联想思维，或将两个看似无关的想法或事物联系在一起，是产生突破性灵感的关键。
                    - 使用7个基本创新问题来创建新的联想： 
                        - 如何从不同的角度进行观察？
                        - 是否能发现新的使用方法？
                        - 如果移动到新的背景环境，会发生什么？
                        - 如果将它与毫不相关的事物互连在一起，会怎么样？
                        - 如果改变某一部分，结果会怎么样？
                        - 是否可以用它创造新事物？
                        - 你还能就此想象出其他东西吗？
                    - 模式识别可以帮助你发现当前状况和已知状况的相似性，从而找到解决问题的方案。
            - 05 阶段4：放飞花园 如何加速产生更多的突破性灵感
                - 埃里克·魏亨麦尔（Erik Weihenmayer）攀登过全球七大洲最高峰，包括尼泊尔境内的珠穆朗玛峰和南极洲的文森峰。作为一名七大洲最高峰的登顶者，魏亨麦尔是极少数精英登山家的一员。但这并不是他最了不起的地方，真正了不起的是，魏亨麦尔双目完全失明。
                - 魏亨麦尔是如何在冰雪中行走的？原来，他在舌头下面安装了一个叫BrainPort的装置，这个装置能把视觉信息转换成电脉冲传给大脑，这也正是我们眼睛的工作方式。
                - 当然，BrainPort无法像眼睛一样通过视神经向大脑传递信息，所以电脉冲是通过舌头上的神经传向大脑的。
                - BrainPort的共同发明者保罗·巴赫伊丽塔（Paul Bach-y-Rita）说：“我们是用大脑而不是用眼睛来看东西的。”只要视觉信息能进入大脑，通过什么方法传递并不重要。
                - 尽管魏亨麦尔的大脑不能天然地理解从舌头传来的视觉信息，但是可以通过神经重塑做到这点。在他的大脑中，数以百万计的神经元彼此形成新的连接，在生理上完成了理解能力的重塑机制。
                - 我们曾经认为，童年过后大脑就不再变化或发展了。新技术出现后，我们能够更深入地观察大脑和脑部神经的变化，之前的误解就此瓦解。神经科学家们发现，大脑的某些部分会根据人们从事活动的不同而增大或缩小。
                - 2014年秋季，一位24岁的中国女孩因为头晕恶心进了医院。检查发现，她的大脑中竟然没有对于语言、运动和平衡功能必不可少的小脑。事实上，这个女孩不仅能走路，而且能说话、用筷子，并且会书法，这些都证明她的大脑已经发生了惊人的改变。她大脑的其他部分代替了缺失的小脑。
                - 2012年的一项研究表明，听觉障碍者的大脑中处理听觉的神经用来处理视觉与触觉。同时，2005年的一项研究指出，视觉障碍者的视觉皮层重塑后改为传输听觉信号。就像魏亨麦尔所说的，那种感觉就像大脑在重新布局。事实正是如此，大脑的生理结构会根据环境而变化。
                - 大脑能够自我改造以弥补功能缺失，这种能力正是神经可塑性的体现。事实上，大脑在我们这一生中都是具有可塑性的。任何情况下，当你遇到新的经验、产生新的想法时，大脑的神经元都会建立新的物理连接。我们的经验和行为始终都在改变大脑的结构。
                    - 大脑始终都在自我重塑。
                    - 生理结构不断发生变化。
                    - 请感受一下这样的过程。
                - 这些与突破有什么关系呢？答案很简单：突破是通过创造新东西来实现的，对大脑来说，就是要创造新观点和新想法。为了产生新想法，我们需要在大脑中建立新连接。事实上，我们创造新连接的速度、难度和丰富性在很大程度上影响着我们能产生突破性灵感的数量，而创造新连接的能力就是神经可塑性。
                - 大脑可塑性越强，越能产生突破
                    - 阿斯特罗·特勒（Astro Teller）是谷歌X实验室的负责人，我们问他是如何雇用员工的，他说：“我会雇用那些我能遇到的可塑性最强的人。”因为他知道，一个人的创新能力取决于他脑部建立新神经连接的能力。
                    - 婴儿时期，我们的大脑具有极强的可塑性，因为那时我们遇到的每件事都是新的：吃饭、排泄、说话、笑、爬行、行走。每一天，大脑都会形成新的结构来让我们理解正在经历的事情，婴儿的大脑就像在进行铁人三项训练。
                    - 越长大，我们接触的新奇的事情就变得越少。日常生活中，我们接触相同的同事、相同的工作、相同的邻居、相同的电视节目、相同的朋友、相同的政治。大脑从铁人三项选手变成了沙发土豆。大脑不再建立新的神经连接，甚至会以年龄为借口拒绝接受新鲜事物。事实上，并不是大脑不再接受改变，而是我们没有采取相应的行动。
                    - 如果你认为一切都太晚了，应该在年轻时就开始锻炼，这就像你坐在沙发上年复一年地看电视，当要做俯卧撑的时候却说：“嗯，我想我现在的体力已经变差。我最好习惯现状，在沙发上坐下来。”
                    - 你可能因此想去玩一种最近流行的“锻炼大脑”的电子游戏或记忆游戏，然而研究表明，迄今为止这些游戏更多的只有娱乐功能。
                    - 提高大脑可塑性最好的方法是，让自己不断接触新事物。当你一次又一次地重复着同样的想法时，大脑激活的神经元总是相同的。但是，当你经历或思考一些不熟悉的事物时，大脑会建立新的神经结构，这种能力正是产生突破性灵感的生理基础。
                    - 我们对新事物的关注在大脑中建立了一个个新的神经连接。每个人的大脑都有1 000亿个神经元，每个神经元都可以延伸出新的连接，也就是说，大脑可以建立的新连接的数量比天上的星星还要多。
                - 不要浪费你的突破多巴胺
                    - 我们生活在一个令人分心的时代。在互联网出现之前，我们能得到的信息量是有限的。现在，我们每一次上网都面临着信息雪崩。利奥·巴巴乌达（Leo Babauta）是“禅的习惯”博客的博主和6个孩子的父亲，他告诉我们：“信息的洪流时刻准备将我们淹没，不断争夺我们的注意力，让我们在多任务的环境中迷失。”
                    - 更糟糕的是，这场争夺注意力的战斗会让我们上瘾，因为脑中所有与数字通信相关的通道都与多巴胺的分泌有关。一种常见的误解是多巴胺可以让人产生快感，但是越来越多的研究表明，多巴胺不会让人感到快乐，而是会激发我们的欲望和冲动。
                    - 在多巴胺的大量分泌下，我们有欲望打开每封电子邮件、短信、Snapchat和Instagram的通知，这个过程让我们感到期待和快乐。电子产品把所有人都变成了赌徒，只不过我们不再拉动老虎机或掷骰子，而是反复检查收件箱和手机。凯利·麦戈尼格尔（Kelly McGonigal）在她的畅销书《自控力》（The Willpower Instinct）中写道，促使我们不断进化的动力是幸福的承诺而不是幸福本身。
                    - 然而，突破性灵感同样是由多巴胺引起的对幸福、兴奋和成就的期待驱动的。多巴胺给了我们好奇心，驱使我们去寻找解决问题的新方法、新突破。但如果我们将多巴胺用于追查电子信息，这就浪费了宝贵的神经化学动力。
                    - 从本质上说，多巴胺创造了产生突破性灵感所需要的动机，不要把它浪费在电子邮件和社交媒体上。
                - 锻炼神经可塑性
                    - 神经可塑性锻炼的目的不在于让你擅长这种锻炼。著名广播节目《新鲜空气》（Fresh Air）的主持人特里·格罗斯（Terry Gross）多年来一直上声乐课。她从一开始就告诉声乐老师，她的目标不是成为一个好歌手，“我只想体验最大程度上全身心沉浸在一首歌里的感觉”。
                    - 站在格罗斯的立场上看，她靠声音录制节目，唱歌确实与她的工作有关。但除此之外，音乐是增强神经可塑性的重要途径。格罗斯需要采访各行各业的人，寻找连接更有利于她提出有趣的问题。
                    - 学习任何新东西都有助于增强你神经的可塑性，并且，在学习新事物的同时还可以做一些体育锻炼，这不仅可以增加神经可塑性，而且会增大你创造的神经回路的规模，这意味着你创建了更多新连接。
                    - 在一项相关研究中，当跳高运动员想象他们成功地越过横杆时，他们的实际成功率就提高了35%，但当他们边想象边移动手指时，成功率增加了45%。这也是以下许多练习都包含某种形式的身体运动的原因。
                    - 这些不是促进产生突破性灵感的练习，而是增进神经可塑性的练习。在比赛来临时，强健的肌肉将对你有利。
                    - 1．运动实验
                        - 用你的非惯用手进行各种活动，比如刷牙、用叉子、用钥匙开门、写名字。这种体验将帮你建立新连接，并获得神经可塑性的高强度锻炼。
                    - 2．味觉实验
                        - 去一家餐馆点一些你以前从未吃过的东西。仔细品尝，这种食物有什么不同之处？为了理解新口味，你的大脑就会建立新连接。
                        - 做一道不放盐的菜，仔细品尝没有盐时的味道。然后逐渐加盐，一点一点地加，感受不断变化的味觉。
                    - 3．视觉实验
                        - 从一条新路线去上班、去市场或者回家，去注意尽可能多的新事物。第二天，走同样的路线并试着预测你将看到的路标。
                        - 花20分钟看一部没有字幕的外国影片，看看你能拼凑出什么样的情节。你是不是更倾向于观察演员的面部表情？在没有语言时，你如何理解角色的心理状态？我最喜欢的外国电影有《美丽人生》（Life is Beautiful）、《天使爱美丽》（Amelie）、《十面埋伏》。
                        - 坐在咖啡馆假装读本书，仔细观察周围的人。别担心，他们正专注于手头的事情，不会注意到你。观察他们的面部表情，他们如何控制身体，他们的动作是快还是慢？他们看上去有没有紧张或者神经质？然后，挑其中一个人，想象一下他早晨是怎么度过的。如果他正在使用电脑，就猜测一下，他是在工作、寻找新房子、购物，还是在给初恋情人写信？给想象填充一些细节：这件事关于谁，为什么会这样，什么时候开始的，后面将如何发展……这些想象都可以锻炼神经可塑性。
                    - 4．听觉实验
                        - 听听来自另一种文化的音乐，比如宝莱坞舞蹈音乐、非洲的蓝调或阿富汗传统音乐，把自己带入完全不同的节奏中。如果是一个人在家，试着跟随音乐跳跳舞。当你试图弄清楚如何将身体融入一个陌生的节奏时，就是在强迫大脑把新的声音转换成动作。
                - 尝试爱因斯坦的思维锻炼方式
                    - 爱因斯坦非常善于做思维实验，他会想象宇宙的真实情况并推理宇宙的未来。这样的思维实验有助于促进联想思维，你可以尝试以下的思维实验。
                        - 重力：想象一下，如果重力将在晚上10点后消失，世界会变成什么样？我们的床会飘到天花板上吗？这将如何改变我们的运动习惯和运输方式？人们会在用网覆盖的树上举行聚会吗？是否会兴起一个制造网的新行业？如果这些网坏了导致人们在空中飘浮了一夜，卖网的人会被起诉吗？会不会有电影讲述人们飘到了一个陌生的地方，然后找到了真爱？青少年会故意破坏网去冒险吗？
                        - 社会规范：假设被人惹恼后踢对方是合法的，世界将是什么样子？如何证明那个人真的惹恼了你？有没有专门的法庭来判定你是否真的被惹恼了？你可以用多大的力气踢别人？是否会出现一种踢人不会留下痕迹的鞋？是否会有一个社会和平运动来制止这种行为？
                        - 年龄：想象一下，如果你突然得知能活到130岁并且健康状况良好，你的第一个反应是什么？你可能会想：“等等，我以为我要活到……”这也许只是一个稍纵即逝的想法，但人们总会这样不自觉地设定期望。你发现自己已经习惯于把这种期望作为衡量指标了吗？试着想象一下130岁时，你的生活会是什么样子，这将如何影响你的决定？你会一直待在现在的工作岗位上吗？你会维持你目前的婚姻或朋友关系吗？如果每个人都能活到130岁，社会将发生怎样的变化？每个人都会有不止一次的婚姻吗？人们要等到什么时候才能生孩子？由于寿命延长而人口过剩，每个人还会有平等的生育机会吗？人们生育子女的权利会被剥夺或出让吗？
                        - 魔法：也许你听说过空中城市的故事，人们在空中行走，人行道一层层地悬挂在高空。或者有一个城市，那里只有密密麻麻的管道、喷头、水池和金属阀门，看上去就像一个悬挂的迷宫。还有一个城市，那里交易的货币是记忆，如果你想购物，就要通过交换记忆来实现。现在，如果由你设计一个神奇的城市，它将是什么样子？那里的人们如何交流，那里的法律和道德规范又是什么？以下就是可以进一步增强神经可塑性的一个方法：想象你在一个场景中，就像在一个虚拟现实中扮演游戏角色一样，你走在街上，打开门，左右观望新事物，然后把手举起感受风的流动。想象你正走在繁华的街道上，时刻注意着交通变化。
                    - 现在让我们谈谈思维实验对你个人的影响，它不仅对增强神经可塑性很有帮助，而且有利于你的工作和生活。回想一下你上次参加的会议：它是在哪里开的，内容是什么，都有谁参加，谁做了发言，你觉得整个会议怎么样？
                    - 现在，利用你增强的想象力，从一个看不见的观察者的角度重新审视这次会议，这样，你可以看见整场会议，包括你自己。观察每个人的脸，包括你自己的面部表情，你看到了什么？记住，你是房间外面一个看不见的观察者。你能感受到人们的情绪吗，是厌烦还是不满？会议的领导者持有什么样的态度？
                    - 准备好更进一步了吗？这是个关键的步骤。把自己想象成这次会议上最年轻的人，如果你本来就是最年轻的，那就把自己想象成最年长的。不要仅仅穿上他的衣服，而是直达灵魂，用他的眼睛看待问题。他现在感觉怎么样，他在看谁，他关心的问题是什么？
                    - 如果要想象一个非工作的场景，那就选择一个家庭聚会。你感觉这个聚会怎么样？有什么让你感到快乐或懊恼的事情吗？从一个客人的角度看待这个聚会：大家的气氛如何，谁在看着谁，谁在吃东西，谁在服务大家，谁看上去很无聊？现在挑选一个最年轻的或最年老的家庭成员，换位思考他现在的感觉。
                - 尽可能收集信息
                    - 在19世纪90年代初期，大家都想拥有最新的技术奇迹，即自行车。它既经济又实惠，可以让人们上下班的时间减半，又能让人们在周末时更方便地享受快乐的乡村生活。
                    - 一夜之间，成千上万的自行车技工涌现出来，他们不断寻找让自行车变得更轻、更安全、更舒适、更容易生产的方法，研究车轮轴承、龙骨、充气轮胎等。
                    - 后来，很多技工都利用他们在车间学到的知识创造了交通领域中更大的突破，像莱特兄弟就是自行车技工出身。
                    - 一个业余的自行车技工看到个人交通工具逐渐进入批量生产阶段，道路也越建越好，于是把大规模生产的新概念和为自行车发明的新工具结合在一起，开创了现代汽车工业，那个人就是亨利·福特。
                    - 给大脑提供的素材越多，它能创造的连接就越多。因此，当你在网上阅读文章时，可以跟随提示的超链接，看看它们能把你带到哪里。在花园中播撒种子是一个漫游的过程，你可能会绕到一个很远的地方，不过没关系，因为也许那里会发生有趣的事情。当然，有些人想确保正在做的事情真的有价值而不是浪费时间，他们可能会感到沮丧，因为永远不会知道哪些事情不浪费时间。但如果你想获得突破性灵感，那就必须接受一个事实：你永远无法确定什么是最终有价值的。
                    - 当农民播种时，他们不知道哪些种子会发芽哪些不会，也不知道有多少发芽的种子会在最后结出果实。100%的发芽率几乎是不可能的，那么农民是怎么做的呢？他们播种比实际需要更多的种子。用军事术语来说，这叫作冗余。在管理领域中，冗余被认为是一种浪费，而在技术世界中，它有时可以拯救你的工作。你是否因为忘记备份而丢失过数据？
                    - “在云计算的技术世界里，我们假设所有正在开发的硬件都会损坏，所以会准备复杂的备份计划。存储在云端的数据通常会被分解成数百个部分，每个部分有3个甚至6个备份。”微软的凯文·索尔说。
                    - 如果你想要更多的突破性灵感，那就要接受冗余的必要性。因为你不知道在收获的季节，哪些种子会结出果实。每颗种子不一定都会发芽，每颗发芽的种子也不一定都能结果，你必须承受这种不确定性（第9章将提供有效的应对工具）。
                    - 当我们让你沉浸在自己的工作或爱好中时，指的不是仅仅让你努力工作或者每天在钢琴前坐两个小时，而是告诉你要弄清楚事情的基本原理、思想流派、成功或失败的具体过程。
                    - 借鉴他人的经验
                        - 经常和你的同行交流，这一点非常重要。贝尔实验室在晶体管、计算机、激光技术、UNIX系统以及许多今天的重要技术领域都做出过重要贡献，它有一个著名的做法：鼓励新成员多与诺贝尔奖获得者和著作原创者进行交流。
                        - 至于如何建立你的人际关系，有很多书可以参考，包括奥利维娅的《精英的人格魅力课》（The Charisma Myth）和基思·法拉奇（Keith Ferrazzi）的《别独自用餐》（Never Eat Alone），后者被称为“社交经典”。基思是一家研究人类行为改变的咨询公司的首席执行官，在《别独自用餐》中，他强有力地论证了关系在商业和生活中所起的重要作用，并教你如何一步步建立需要的关系。
                        - 流行的商业神话会让你误以为创新是一个人单独努力完成的，但是更多时候，创新是很多人齐心协力的结果。在花园播种阶段，你要做的不仅是从其他人那里提取信息，而且要开诚布公地告诉大家你所面临的问题，并提供相关的背景资料，然后描述你的瓶颈以及希望达到的目标。
                        - 播种的时候，你的心态必须是开放的、公正的，因为你永远不知道谁会给你提供一个有趣的办法。记住，在突破性灵感形成的早期阶段，它看起来不像是突破，而更像一系列繁杂的信息。所以，要时刻保持开放、好奇的心态。
                        - 有一个技巧是，在任何时候都把某些话题放在心中最重要的位置，这样你就更有可能随时注意到相关的信息。另一个技巧是，引导人们谈论他们热衷的事情，问问他们第一次被这件事吸引时的情景，他们是否至今仍陶醉其中？他们谈论的这件事到底是关于什么活动的？你可能会听到关于这件事的历史和很多细节，也有可能听到做这件事的最佳方案，这些都是你花园的重要养分。
                        - 你应该阅读一些相邻领域的图书，与不是同行但同你行业相关的人交谈。如果你是一家医疗保健公司的经理，那你就可以和一家零售公司或酒店公司的经理谈谈。如果你是一个生意人，也可以试着了解一家幼儿园的运营体系。
                        - 如果你做销售或市场营销方面的工作，那你就可以读关于美国著名巡回马戏团老板巴纳姆（P. T. Barnum）的书，或者关于威廉·赫斯特（William Hearst）在美西战争开始时的作用的书，还可以读托马斯·潘恩（Thomas Paine）的《常识》（Common Sense）和与美国独立战争相关的书。
                        - 如果你是一名管理者，那就看看如何组织军队以及如何在不同文化的士兵之间建立起联系，或者读一下从北美洲到大洋洲的原住民的传统实践，这些都将有益于你的工作。
                        - 如果你是一位科学家，阅读有关科学史的任何东西都是很有帮助的。阅读哲学史也不失为一种好方法，这将帮你了解不同的思维模式，从而发现自己思维的局限性。许多科学家认为，科幻小说里也蕴藏着海量的灵感。
                        - 如果你是一个企业家，不妨读一下硅谷创业前辈们的故事。你永远不知道这些阅读将激发你拥有怎样的想法。
                - 突破工作坊 向相邻领域学习
                    - StartX是斯坦福大学的高新科技公司孵化器。那里有一群来自各行业聪明、上进、雄心勃勃的年轻人，他们有许多不知道该如何实践的新想法。在一家可穿戴技术公司的交流会上，联合创始人们告诉朱达，他们有一个关于智能织物的新想法，但是他们只知道这种技术的用途，却不了解材料和温度变化方面的知识。
                    - 朱达把他的一个客户，即做滑雪服装设计的北面公司介绍给了这家公司。设计滑雪服装必须考虑很多关于材料和温度的问题，使用者在寒冷的室外活动，需要用这些衣服保持体温。可穿戴技术公司的创始人和北面的设计师在相邻的领域工作，通过向北面的设计师学习，他们在设计上取得了长足的进步。
                    - 我们很想告诉你，他们把智能织物推向了市场，但可惜他们发现技术还不够成熟，这也是与初创公司合作的风险所在。有时候，事情可能不成功，但这不是突破性灵感的终点，它需要继续学习和不断地尝试。本书第二部分将深入探究获得突破性复原力所需的技能。
                    - 为了提出相对论，爱因斯坦没有把自己锁在房间里，相反，他有一群可以彻夜长谈的朋友，他们自称“奥林匹亚学会”，这些人包括米歇尔·贝索（Michele Besso）、莫里斯·索洛文（Maurice Solovine）、康拉德·哈比希特（Conrad Habicht）以及爱因斯坦的妻子米列娃（Mileva Marić）。
                    - 在无数个温暖的夜晚，他们走过伯尔尼的街道，然后坐在河岸上畅谈。有时他们会爬上古尔腾山（Mount Gurten），背靠大地，仰望星空，一直聊到天亮。然后他们会漫步回镇上的咖啡馆，享受咖啡，迎接新想法的到来。
                    - 奥林匹亚学会有一个小规矩：所有成员都要全勤参加讨论。当莫里斯·索洛文躲开讨论去参加音乐会的时候，爱因斯坦和哈比希特就会去他家，吃光他的食物，抽烟斗（爱因斯坦）和雪茄（哈比希特），直到整个房间烟雾缭绕，像烟囱一样。最后，他们把所有的家具和书都堆到床上，这些就是对索洛文缺席的惩罚。
                    - 奥林匹亚学会的成员来自不同的领域，如诗歌和哲学，正是这些天马行空的对话帮助爱因斯坦开启了宇宙的奥秘。为了创新，爱因斯坦需要改变他原有的想法，这意味着他首先要远离物理领域。
                    - 当我们处于解决问题的模式时，文学、艺术和音乐这些被认为“不可操作的”或“不实用的”知识对于产生突破性灵感非常重要。娜佳·迪科瓦（Nadya Direkova）就是一个例子，她是毕业于美国麻省理工学院的数学天才，在谷歌X实验室工作，开发了“设计冲刺法”。她会参加各种课程，包括摄影和课程《如何在这个世界上当一条美人鱼》（How to be a mermaid in the world）。
                    - 如果你正在与相邻领域的人交谈，就可以问一些好问题：
                        - 如何向一个6岁的孩子描述你的工作？
                        - 你有没有一些让你受益的理念或原则？
                        - 你是怎样将工作做得这样好的？（听到这个问题，他们可能感觉受宠若惊。）
                        - 如果我要从零开始干你的工作，你会给我什么建议？
                        - 你一直都知道自己想从事什么职业，还是有别的兴趣？（如果他们一直很清楚自己的方向，就问问对方为何有这样的认知。如果他们有其他兴趣，就问他们是如何将自己的第一兴趣和第二兴趣联系在一起的。）
                    - 如果你担心掉进“兔子洞”，就试着读一读“牛津通俗读本”系列图书。这些书一般100页左右，内容涵盖从藏传佛教到分子生物学等诸多领域，你可以选择阅读其中两三个不同的主题。这些书的优点就是简明扼要，信息量有限。
                    - 向大自然学习
                        - 如果你想要一个新的洞察视角，可以带着好奇心去观察不同年龄、不同社会阶层或不同文化的人。你还可以从大自然中寻找解决方案，这也是我们之前提到的仿生学方法。
                        - 日本第一辆动车的时速可达290千米，它有一个短而倾斜、像鼻子一样的车头。一般而言，如果以如此惊人的速度前行，火车在穿越隧道时常常会产生飓风级强风，这将震动附近的房屋，甚至震碎窗户玻璃。工程师模仿翠鸟长喙重新设计了火车头的造型，减少了空气的积聚，从而解决了这一问题。
                        - 给你大脑中的突破天才们提供其他人各种各样的成功经验，这样做至关重要，而且经验越多越好，这些“其他人”拥有你需要的潜在解决方案，这些经验最终会变成你的财富。
                        - 津巴布韦首都哈拉雷的东门中心是一栋购物大楼和办公楼，仅仅同等面积建筑10%的能源就能满足它制冷和制热的需求。这个建筑是通过模仿白蚁的巢穴结构设计的，这种结构不受外界温度的影响，能始终维持稳定的内部温度。建筑内部就像一个小小的城堡，建筑物两端的大型风扇抽取建筑物底部的冷空气，在高层排出热空气，由此保持建筑物内的恒温状态。
                        - 突破性灵感的一种简单来源就是自然世界。例如，过去废物处理厂常常面临因矿物质在管道内部堆积而导致流速减缓的问题。传统的解决方法是，用有毒的化学物质冲洗管道。这种矿物质的主要成分是碳酸钙，成分和贝壳相同。在成长阶段，贝类通过从海水中获得蛋白质的方式凝结碳酸钙，在成熟后，贝类会分泌一种蛋白质阻止碳酸钙继续结晶。如今，技术人员将这种生物技术应用到商业领域，获得了绿色环保的解决方案。
                    - 用一个固定的方式记录你的想法
                        - 你需要一个方式，专门用来收集来自大自然的灵感，你可以把它们记在特定的文档中，比如手机的记事本、电脑的文件夹或者纸质笔记本。你需要给你脑中的突破天才们提供一个浏览资料、专注工作的场所。有一个简单实用的方法能帮你产生突破性灵感：回顾你曾经收集的想法，然后做下一章中任意一个突破性练习。
                        - 产生突破性灵感的过程既是一种社会性的专注于外部的体验，又是一种孤独的反观内心的体验。即使你只是坐在电脑前阅读文章，外部信息也会不断涌入。
                        - 在花园的播种阶段，我们鼓励你走出去和其他人交谈，因为与其他人交流时，双方的联想网络会产生连接，从而可能在一个全新的领域产生创新。同样，我们可以通过研究、阅读、交流、争论、解释、看电影、听课，甚至和不同的人共进午餐等方式来收集不同的想法、事实和信息。
                - 本章小结 如何加速产生更多的突破性灵感
                    - 我们的大脑始终具有可塑性，有能力形成新思想。虽然每个人或多或少都有神经系统状况，但我们可以增强神经可塑性。
                    - 别把你的突破多巴胺浪费在电子邮件、手机等让你分心的事物上。
                    - 锻炼是增强神经可塑性并改善心情的神奇子弹。一次练习5分钟，就会有帮助。你可以进行4种实验，来增强神经可塑性：运动实验，味觉实验，视觉实验，听觉实验。
                    - 尝试爱因斯坦的思维实验。想象一个疯狂的情形或规则不同的世界，看看它会让你想到些什么。
                    - 尽量收集你所关注的问题的所有相关信息，让自己沉浸在这个领域中。你可以：借鉴他人经验；向大自然学习；以及用一个固定的方式记录想法，方便日后参考。
            - 06 阶段5：自由飞翔 如何实现突破性思维
                - 现在，你是不是已经不止一次地产生过突破性灵感？这些突破性灵感都很有潜力。这时候，你是不是想赌上房子搏一把？但请等一下，这时候你要做的其实是回到办公室。你可能听过这样一句话：“醉来写作，醒时编辑。”现在是醒来编辑的时候了。
                - 爱德华·德·波诺（Edward de Bono）是思考方法领域的顶级专家之一，还是一位心理学家兼内科医生，并在牛津、剑桥和哈佛大学任教。他提出的最著名的工具之一就是六顶思考帽。这个经典的工具是给团队成员安排6种不同颜色的帽子，每种颜色代表不同的思维框架，团队成员通过不同的角度观察情境，并由此集思广益提出可行方案。
                    - 蓝色帽子注重过程和时间管理，站在大局上考虑问题。
                    - 白色帽子考虑的重点是事实、数字、指标等现实情况。
                    - 红色帽子关注的是情境和解决方案对其他人的情感共鸣及潜在影响，包括同理心和畏惧等情绪。
                    - 绿色帽子注重创造性思维，致力于发现新的可能性，找到对情境和解决方案的新观点和改进方案。
                    - 黑色帽子持有怀疑的态度，更关注计划的风险、弱点、潜在的问题和缺陷。
                    - 黄色帽子站在乐观的角度，从正面思考问题，聚焦于潜在解决方案的益处和最佳情境。
                - 用六顶思考帽筛选你的想法
                    - 我们对这个工具进行了调整，现在，它能帮助你捕捉那些有潜力的突破性灵感，识别出无用的信息。
                    - 虽然一些突破性灵感会被立即辨认出来，但更多的时候，重大的突破性灵感是通过一系列较小的突破汇总形成的。我们沿着这条创新的道路蜿蜒前行，最终到达了关键时刻。这个评估过程将帮助你识别那些不那么明显的创新想法，并告诉你，哪些观点是获得突破性灵感的指路标，哪些只是零散的奇思妙想。
                    - 假设你有关于你的团队该如何发展的突破性灵感，也已经意识到团队需要冒险精神，但同时也要控制风险。现在，选择一顶你要戴的帽子，然后从那个角度去思考问题。你可以从任何一顶帽子开始。
                    - 例如，你先选那顶关注情绪的红色帽子。首先问问自己，如果鼓励团队成员承担更多风险，他们会感到害怕吗，会有压力吗，会感到自由吗？这让你意识到，在某种程度上，他们的感受取决于你如何提出这个问题。
                    - 然后你戴上怀疑论者的黑色帽子，你是发现问题的人，会看到潜在的风险：团队可能会超出预算，错过截止日期，以冒险的名义建立无用的模型。甚至会出现一种情况，他们只是在做一些奇怪的事情，让自己看起来是在冒险。如果你因此斥责他们，他们会感到困惑，觉得受到了欺骗。因为你鼓励他们冒险，却又因此惩罚他们。你会失去团队的信任。
                    - 你又戴上白色帽子，实事求是地考虑问题，你有多少时间可利用？你有多少预算来承担风险？有哪些领域不该碰触？这些将帮助你设置限制条件。
                    - 接着，你戴上那顶绿色帽子来创造性地思考这些限制条件。你可以在开始前给团队设立怎样的合理限制和指导方向？你可以提出每个人创新的权限并建立一个系统，所有新想法都必须通过系统的审核，以此把控创新的进度。
                    - 然后，你戴上黄色帽子，看看这些新想法有什么好处，它们能带来怎样的成功？
                    - 你再次戴上红色帽子，看看你的团队会如何接受这些新的指导方针，然后再戴上黑色帽子，看看会不会有什么新变化。
                    - 现在是时候戴上蓝色帽子了，从大局上思考，以确保你的想法仍然在既定的主题范围内。
                    - 你可以反复戴上这些不同颜色的帽子，从这些不同的角度思考得越多，对你越有帮助。
                    - 接下来，与戴着不同帽子的人交流突破性灵感。也许你会找到一个戴着红色帽子的人，他有很高的情商，善于设身处地为别人着想。把你目前的情况和可能的方案告诉他，看看他能给你什么反馈。
                    - 然后你去找一个戴着黑色帽子的人，他有很好的批判性思维和质疑能力。让他了解你的情况，看看他能指出什么问题，这样你就得到了批判性反馈。
                    - 你继续与戴着其他颜色帽子的人交流，收集不同角度的反馈信息，它们能帮你筛选自己的想法。
                    - 评估你产生的突破性想法，判断哪些方面是值得继续努力的，哪些问题需要进一步思考，哪些地方尚未成熟，从别人的反馈中发现问题对你而言非常重要。
                - 突破工作坊 六顶思考帽在程序开发中的应用
                    - 一家在StartX的初创公司想开发一款智能手机的应用程序，它能跟踪用户的运动情况，并向用户提供他们一天、一周和一个月的运动综述。这个应用程序并不在StartX既定的领域里，并且，这家初创公司也不确定是否应该继续推进这个程序的开发。
                    - 这是一个使用六顶思考帽的完美机会。朱达发现在这家公司有6个人天生就各戴一顶思考帽。首先，他选了一个善于全面了解事实的戴白色帽子的人，这个人用简明的语言把团队遇到的问题清晰地描述了一遍。然后，他选了积极乐观的戴黄色帽子的人，这个人列举了这个程序可以应用的场景和对改变世界的贡献，比如，父母可以记录孩子有记忆之前的生活，孩子们在十几岁时可以了解他们父母的故事，政客们可能被追究责任，研究人员可以通过行为数据库研究人类的行为。
                    - 然后他请戴绿色帽子的创造性思考者发言。这个人想知道应用程序是否可以用来追踪宠物的行动，或是创建一个叙事网络，以此观察朋友们甚至整个初中班里同学的交互情况。这一群人的行为数据又能告诉我们什么呢？
                    - 听到这一点后，创始人开始变得非常兴奋，但是朱达还是先请善于提出质疑的戴黑色帽子的人发言。这个人指出，这项技术还不足以记录复杂的叙事网络，同时置疑人们会为这个应用付钱。人们应该会希望它是免费的，另外应该如何在应用上投放广告呢？
                    - 愉快的讨论还没有结束。接下来是戴红色帽子的思想家，他擅长感性思维。他对这个应用感到不寒而栗，因为他觉得这个程序很可怕，感觉自己就像被跟踪了。如果你打开它，接着退出，然后再打开，你的行动记录中会有空缺，这让你看起来好像在刻意隐藏什么一样，就像《1984》描绘的场景。
                    - 但讨论没有偏题。朱达让一位戴蓝色帽子的思考者发言，他向创始人提问，这个应用程序最初的蓝图是什么，本质是什么。这个问题把那位戴着绿色帽子的创造性思考者带回了现实。在交换了很多想法后，他们意识到这个应用程序已经被限定为是用于跟踪人们日常生活的，但其实它也可以用于科学研究，这个想法早就提出过，但后来被遗忘了。这个应用程序可以用于为病人诊断疾病，或者使用在任何愿意体验这个程序的人身上。
                    - 这个团队在开发过程中遇到了一些问题，我们帮他们保持突破复原力。有一天，他们遇到了一位从事医疗技术的企业家。在双方交谈的过程中，他们意识到目前大多数的医学技术都集中在生物识别、心率、出汗率、氧合状况等方面，但是这些技术还不足以监测一个人一整天的活动，监测全天的活动情况及其对健康的影响在当时还是蓝海领域。于是，这个企业家并购了这家正处于一轮融资中的公司。
                    - 麻省理工学院科学与人类动力学实验室主任阿莱克斯·彭特兰（Alex “Sandy”Pentland）教授是奥利维娅最喜欢的科学家，他强烈建议人们亲自去争取反馈。
                    - “当事情发生的时候，”他说，“你需要丰富的感应方式：通过细致入微的交流和互动，让发现自然而然地到来。你需要面对面地交流，这样双方可以你一言我一语地快乐交谈，你因此会对一个观点有真切的了解。”
                    - 这就是麻省理工学院只有一个校区的原因：他们希望师生可以面对面交流。是的，也正因如此，它往往被讽刺为最具有“书呆子气息的世界一流大学”。
                    - 指导创建麻省理工学院媒体实验室的彭特兰同样建议你，每次只找一个人交流，不要追求速度而和一群人交流。“想想马文·明斯基（Marvin Minsky）和那些特立独行的天才们，”他说，“是的，他们有点古怪，并对一切都很好奇。当他们获得灵感时，他们会兴奋地向所有人谈起自己感兴趣的事情，但他们与每个人的谈话都很认真，会根据一个人的意见做出反馈，然后再和另一个人交谈，从而不断试验和验证自己的观点，直到把所有概念建立起来。”
                    - 彭特兰描述了另一种模式切换。除了在执行网络和默认网络之间切换以外，也可以在“与人交流”和“独自思考”之间切换。
                    - 这种模式间的转换解决了一个如何产生突破性灵感的核心悖论。一方面，我们需要独自一人来实现创新。无数的故事告诉我们，灵感的产生是一个安静的内在过程，人类的洞察力来自孤独。另一方面，我们需要沉浸在观点的洪流中。我们需要听听别人在想什么，在做什么，并了解很多不同的事情。
                    - 关于思想在团体和组织中的流动模式，彭特兰的团队正在进行最前沿的研究，他的书在各大创新领域得到了高度认可。他介绍了蜜蜂授粉的方式：蜜蜂在每一朵花上采下最好的花粉，然后传授到下一朵花上。
                    - 这里有一个有用的提示：有些花的花粉更多。当你想和别人谈论你的突破性灵感时，去找形形色色的人聊，尤其是那些具有“复合经历”的人。这里举一个例子。美国万宝盛华公司（Manpower）的前首席执行官戴维·亚克力斯（David Arkless），他曾在多家跨国企业担任高管，曾在这些公司之外担任顾问，曾致力于在中国获得更多的投资机会，也曾向中东和北非的无业青年传授加入全球化经济的技能。
                - 模仿大脑模式，组建可信赖的团队
                    - 许多突破性灵感都来自可信赖的分享各自观点的团队成员，比如爱因斯坦和他的奥林匹亚学会，托尔金（J. R. R. Tolkien）和刘易斯（C. S. Lewis）分别读过对方的《魔戒》（The Lord of the Rings）和《纳尼亚传奇》（The Chronicles of Narnia）的初稿，纳撒尼尔山·霍桑（Nathaniel Hawthorne）和赫尔曼·梅尔维尔（Herman Melville）是好朋友且经常通过书信交流作品。
                    - 有可以信赖的团队非常重要，他们知道你在做什么，你可以放心地和他们分享想法，如果他们还能通过提问帮你明确思路或推动你进入新的领域，那就再好不过了。
                    - 当基思·理查兹第一次听《满足》的开头8小节时，他不为所动。滚石乐队主唱米克·贾格尔（Mick Jagger）这样描述当时的情景：
                    - 它听起来就像一首民歌，在我们刚开始创作的时候，基思不太喜欢这首歌，他不想特立独行，也不看好这首歌的前景。我认为基思的想法有些片面，他只是太熟悉这首歌了，才没有发现它的优点。
                    - 虽然理查兹没有察觉那首歌的突破性潜力，但他的队友帮他发现了。第一次录制的过程并不顺利，但他们随即又进行了第二次尝试。你的团队可以成为你捕捉蝴蝶的“备用网”，帮你抓到你没看见的蝴蝶。
                    - 安德烈亚斯·拉莫斯（Andreas Ramos）是一位有20多年工作经验的硅谷工程师，在一次与朱达的谈话中，他说了一个关于他同事的故事。那是20世纪90年代中期，他的同事谈论了一些自己的想法，拉莫斯和另一个人开始发表见解，并决定帮助这位同事克雷格（Craig）写代码。是的，那些代码就是分类广告网站Craigslist的雏形。
                    - 那么你该如何选择你信任的伙伴，谁应该参与其中呢？选择那些在6种思考风格中擅长1～2种的人。这就涉及一个更深层的问题：要形成突破性灵感，你的团队需要什么技能？
                    - 从设计的角度来看，大自然是顶级设计师。你的大脑经过了数百万年的反复测试、不断适应和反复迭代，才发展成今天的样子。建筑师能够从白蚁的巢穴中学到如何节约能源，工程师可以从翠鸟的长喙里发现空气动力学，想想你能从哪些角度获得突破性灵感。
                    - 你可以模仿默认网络的工作方式，以下是在寻找你的伙伴或团队时可以考虑的3大品质和4种类型。
                    - 3大品质
                        - 1．同理心：寻找那些善于接受他人观点，并且天生有能力去感受别人对新想法反应的人。你需要那些当他人遇到困难时选择的倾诉对象。
                        - 2．复合经历：你需要那些有在不同行业工作经历的人或者学习多个专业的人，比如同时学过数学和诗歌、法语和经济学的人。你还需要那些在工作之外还有个人兴趣的人，比如练习太极拳的计算机程序员或油漆工人。
                        - 3．记忆力：历史学家或对历史感兴趣的人可能有这个特长。在类似领域有过突破性灵感的人、曾经寻找突破性灵感并反思经验的人，也将对你有所帮助。
                    - 4种类型
                        - 1．专家：理想的团队成员应该是市场、公司和文化方面的专家。你希望有人告诉你，在5年内会发生什么事，在未来的6个月内有哪些巨大的改变将会发生。这些人可以评估你的突破性灵感，告诉你这个想法是否足够新颖、特别，并告诉你它未来的发展方向。
                        - 2．创造者：你需要机械工程师、设计师、建筑工人以及绘制和制作各类模型的人，他们对开展工作都有非常具体的想法，你需要脚踏实地。
                        - 3．理论家：你需要对某些知识有深入了解的人，即使他们从来没有进行实践，只是一直从事研究工作。理论家往往能提供深层次的见解和创新思路，这些观点正是那些只关心应用的人可能会错过的。这些人中有一些年纪稍大。
                        - 4．通才（多面手）：这些人有广博的知识，也具有很好的获取新信息的能力。他们会学习新事物并进行整合，然后再与其他事物联系起来。就算是不太了解的话题，他们也可能做出重要贡献，因为欠缺这些知识正好能让他们打开灵感的大门，创造连接与洞见。
                    - 有两个办法可以帮助你和你的团队仿生大脑，从而产生突破性灵感。第一个办法是添加催化剂。
                    - 你放下手头的工作后，脑力就会回到你脑中的天才休息室，同时，大脑的记忆储存区域海马体也开始整理你学到的所有新东西并储存新记忆。海马体有一个怪癖：在形成记忆碎片的同时，它会将这些碎片信息抛到天才休息室里。这就是不断收集新信息的重要性所在，这些新信息就像天才休息室的催化剂。
                    - 因此，给你的突破天才们来点新鲜元素是激发灵感的好主意。
                - 突破练习 给天才团队添点催化剂
                    - 增加一个新成员或随机加一个人。
                    - 换一个新的工作地点。
                    - 设定一个荒谬的目标，执行一个小时，比如收集办公室里所有的橙色便签纸。
                    - 读一本书的一两页。
                    - 观看电影的一个场景或整部电影。
                    - 分享具体的故事，比如你最糟糕的假期或你上学时感觉最好的一天。
                    - 研究任何事物的历史，比如一栋建筑、一种运动、一个国家或洞穴艺术。
                    - 另一个可以仿生大脑的办法是让某个人担任类似执行网络的角色。以下是具体的做法：
                        - 提名一个人当执行网络。
                        - 大家达成一致意见。
                        - 执行网络对整个团队宣布问题，即使每个人都知道问题是什么。
                        - 执行网络退后一步，让团队开始讨论。
                        - 执行网络介入，指出讨论中特别有趣的想法或指出讨论的方向，然后再次退出。
                    - 继续上述过程。执行网络引导着天才论坛，确保团队不会掉进陷阱。
                - 头脑风暴法，对突破性灵感进行审视
                    - 汤姆·齐（Tom Chi）是具有传奇色彩的硅谷创意天才，他开头脑风暴会议的方式值得借鉴。我们发现他的这套规则非常适合团队用来测试突破性灵感的效果。这个方案也具有明确的逻辑结构，让你能自如地邀请他人加入这一过程。
                        - 1．首先让每个人都陈述一下有助于突破的可行方法，把它们写在白板上。设定一个目标，比如列出15个可行方法。
                        - 2．不要为它们排序，而是随意都写在白板上。没有列表，没有优先级，没有顶部，也没有底部。
                        - 3．在每个方法旁边画一幅画。图片将激活大脑的非语言功能区。
                        - 正如齐告诉我们的：“你所做的事情就是把通常是线性、有序、口头的东西，转化为非线性、并行和可视化的东西。”
                        - 接下来的一部分很重要。
                        - 4．告诉每个人尽最大努力不评判任何事情。尽量保持开放的心态，不要发表意见。尽量不要把你的自我意识加到白板上的想法中。
                        - 齐建议你花30分钟做完前面的事情，然后你需要创造一个过渡时刻。
                        - 5．安静两分钟。告诉每个人都要全神贯注地看白板，把这些想法联系起来。
                        - 安静和观察白板是为了让执行网络来指导默认网络内的天才们展开联想，为天才们提供空间可以将事物联系起来。你正在创造一种仪式，让每个人都进入联想状态。
                        - 6．让人们在白板上画线，把他们认为有联系的想法连起来。不同的连接使用不同颜色的标记。白板开始看起来像蜘蛛网。没关系，之后它自然会变得有规律。
                        - 7．让人们讲述他们关于这些联系的小故事，并详细解释这些联系。这些故事促使人们进一步建立联系。
                        - 8．重复连接的想法集群将开始出现。一旦你有了6个、8个、10个想法集群，就问问人们对此的感觉，要求他们按1～10对集群进行评分。
                        - 9．只看那些得分在7分或7分以上的集群。
                    - 这个过程让你和你信任的团队共同审视你们的突破性灵感，发现它的所有可能性。你可能发现它根本不起作用，也可能发现它只有部分起作用，其他部分还有缺失或需要更多的思考。
                - 限制盒，寻找更大的突破
                    - 爱迪生没有发明灯泡。第一个灯泡的专利申请发生在1841年的英国，但40年后，爱迪生却创造了第一个有商业价值的灯泡，这件事不是他一个人完成的。弗朗西斯·罗宾斯·厄普顿（Francis Robbins Upton）毕业于普林斯顿大学，德国科学家赫尔曼·冯·亥姆霍兹（Hermann von Helmholtz）把他推荐给了爱迪生。自学成才的爱迪生怀疑大学教育的可信度，但他还是雇用了厄普顿，并让他着手改良灯泡。
                    - 为了找到合适的灯丝材料，厄普顿建立了一个限制盒。第一个限制条件是灯丝要有高电阻，这意味着它不会消耗很多能量。第二个限制条件是灯丝发光时产生的热量要低，这意味着它在能量较低时也可以使用。第三个限制条件是它要能发出足够的光。第四个限制条件是灯丝的寿命要长，以保障灯泡的经济性。
                    - 一旦建立了限制盒，厄普顿和他的团队就列出了所有符合这些标准的材料清单。然后他们尝试每一种材料，直到找到炭化竹丝，这种材料制成的灯丝能够持续发光1 200个小时。
                    - 限制盒不仅能帮助厄普顿产生突破性灵感，而且有助于评估天才模式的输出。朱达把这个工具提供给了基因泰克制药公司的研究团队，他们抱怨美国政府的规章制度太繁琐。于是朱达让他们列出所有必须遵守的规章制度，他用这些规则建造了一个限制盒。
                    - 这个限制盒清楚地界定了研究人员可操作的空间。这些限制条件集中了他们的精力，让他们接受监管而不是一味抗拒，并用它们来确定自己的工作范围。
                    - 接着，朱达要求研究人员分享他们所有的假设，并全部写下来。他把这些假设一个一个地念出来，并问每一个人：“这是正确的吗？”他大声地说出这句话，许多假设都遭到了挑战，然后被否定。随着团队自信的逐渐增强，房间里的正能量也增加了。
                    - 尽管药物研究是一个漫长而复杂的过程，但如今，该团队仍在使用限制盒和假设挑战来解决问题。
                    - 把限制盒绘制出来，可以把整个过程变得可视化。
                        - •	◎　想想所有存在于你和你所寻求的突破性灵感之间的限制。比如，一共有8个限制条件。
                        - •	◎　画一个大立方体，确保它中间有一个大的空间。
                        - •	◎　在立方体的外侧画出8个正方形。
                        - •	◎　在每个正方形里面写一个限制条件。
                    - 现在你有了一个限制盒，那个大大的空白的中心就是填写解决方案的空间。这个空白中心要留得足够大，让你能把它看作一个充满机会的空间，而不是限制。
                    - 你可以对限制盒采取两种做法：第一，把突破性灵感放进去，看看是否满足限制条件；第二，可以用它来设置限制条件，然后让思绪漫游。
                    - 现在，在限制盒外面的空白处写下你所有的假设、假设的所有限制条件和突破性灵感。把它们写下来，看着它们，然后问问自己，这些假设的限制条件是否都是真的。你可以依次测试这些假设的限制条件，如果是错误的，就要删除这条限制，这样你的限制盒会突然有一个开口。这个开口就是产生突破性灵感的突破口。
                    - 但更重要的是，限制盒为默认网络创建了一个产生突破性灵感的平台。它会围绕你的问题设置参数，然后通过设定假设，让默认网络测试各种可能的突破性灵感。
                - 采取行动
                    - 为了判断某个想法是不是突破性灵感，可以尝试实践它。我们常常停留在突破性灵感的产生阶段，却没有把它们付诸实践。开始动手吧，测试它们，采取行动。这也是需要模式切换的原因。如果你在默认网络中产生了一个突破性灵感，它还不是真正的突破性灵感，你必须用它做点什么，把它应用到实践中去才可以。如果你抓住了蝴蝶，就需要确保它能自由飞翔。
                - 本章小结 怎么实现突破性灵感
                    - 爱德华·德·波诺的六顶思考帽是很好的评估工具。你的潜在突破性灵感需要获得别人的反馈，这会为你提供新洞察，同时帮你辨识可能的盲点。
                    - 仿生你的大脑，组建可信赖的团队。 
                        - 理想团队需要的3大品质是：同理心，复合经历，记忆力。
                        - 理想团队需要具备4种类型的成员：专家，创造者，理论家，通才。
                    - 利用汤姆·齐的头脑风暴法，对突破性灵感进行审视。这套流程能帮你找出所有的可能性或者发现其中的问题。
                    - 构建限制盒。你可以对限制盒采取两种做法： 
                        - 第一，把突破性灵感放进去，看看是否满足限制条件；
                        - 第二，可以用它来设置限制条件，然后让思绪漫游。
                    - 把突破性灵感放进现实世界，看看会发生什么。
